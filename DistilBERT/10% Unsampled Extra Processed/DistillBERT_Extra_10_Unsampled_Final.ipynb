              " 'steve mcqueens shame is a depressing mix of loneliness and sex michael fassbender and carey mulligan play respectively brandon and sissy a pair of siblings both are successful in their own way brandon is a successful executive who lives in new york city in a luxurious apartment with glass walls has a huge lg television placed right on the floor next to his bed and listens to bach yet he does not have friends outside his work circle brings home and visits prostitutes has random casual sex with any woman who is interested is addicted to internet porn and on one occasion when he is unable to seduce a woman at a bar and is roughed up by her boyfriend he just in one night first walks into a gay bar shares a passionate kiss with a man and then makes that man fellate him and then walks over to two prostitutes and has a threesome with them however his acts of sex arent for enjoyment he is such an insomniac or so lonely that he gets up even before his alarm goes off he masturbates even after he has just had sex and while he is penetrating a woman or being fellated by a man you cant see even an ounce of pleasure on his face he is in pain frustrated and angry and accompanying those sex scenes is a hauntingly morbid background score that underlines brandons loneliness while he is engaged in an act that should be pleasurable you feel sorry for him on one occasion when he dates a colleague and brings her home the colleague is prepared to have sex but brandon is unable to do it is he commitmentphobic does he deliberately wish to remain alone shame puts forward these questions in a very stylish and subtle manner and those face closeups of brandon and the sad background score reminded me of two other stylish films on the theme of loneliness and relationships wong karwais in the mood for love and 2046 sissy on the other hand is not like brandon she is a successful singer who has gigs at posh venues all over the us but sissy doesnt have a permanent place to stay shame through sissys loneliness or her choice to remain unattached also seems to ask questions about what is permanent sissy is supposed to be averse to having possessions of any kind except what she really needs despite being successful she does not own a car does not know how to drive one and prefers to take a bus or a taxi however unlike brandon she wants to connectto anyone who would care for her she is heard pleading to her boyfriend on the phone that she would leave everything if he just accepts her the boyfriend doesnt relent before her show in new york city sissy calls up brandon a number of times to inform him of her arrival but brandon lets all her calls go to the voice mail and ignores her completely when she finally turns up apparently unannounced he calls her a burden a hindrance in his apparently welllaid out life sissy just wants to be held to find a root somewhere the scene where both brothersister are sitting on a couch watching some black and white cartoon on the tv and they have just had this argument brandon calling sissy a burden while sissy reasoning that they are after all brother and sister and have no one else in their lives except one another and that they need to look after one another sissy tells brandon she wants to be hugged and brandon after some thought holds her close to his body comforting her this entire scene has been shot from the back of both the actors the cartoon on the tv can be seen but not the expressions on the face of both the actors all the drama all the pain all the garbled chemistry between this brothersister duo is realised through the voices of the actors alone and this is one brilliant scene in another interesting scene as dusk falls brandon watches a posh welllit multistoreyed glassfronted building where on one floor a man is taking a woman from the behind the couple pressed against the huge glass window on another floor a lone suited man perhaps as lonely as brandon is walking to and fro aimlessly while on another floor a man perhaps wary of the world outside and trying to feel secure in his glass house is drawing the curtainsscenes from a modern urban life finally after a tragedy brandon accepts sissy as his only family michael fassbender is awesome he cries he curses he is broken down completely same with carey mulligan though i will always remember this cute british girl as kitty bennet from joe wrights film pride prejudice mulligan in shame is more in the mould of her character of lynn barber in the film an education cute yet intense also mulligans chemistry with older actors is magical remember her chemistry with peter sarsgaard in an education steve mcqueen is some kind of genius both 12 years a slave and shame are about bondage but of different types while 12 years a slave was about a freed slave being pushed into slavery again and taking twelve years to get the authorities to free him again shame is about being tied up by our circumstances in the contemporary era when all of us are supposed to be free and independent shame is highly disturbing but it is also highly touching hats off to everyone involved in the making of

              " 'i kept putting off watching whiplash as part of my effort to watch all of imdbs top 250 despite its current placement at an impressive 45th ranking and an 85 rating i must admit i did feel before watching this film that i would find it overrated and i do hold that opinion just now but to a much smaller extent and that the subject matter wouldnt be highly engaging i guess i was wrong to make those assumptions in hindsight for the most partthe film is basically about a talented young drummer andrew played by miles teller who is taken to his limits by his tormenting and brutal mentor fletcher played by jk simmons andrew has to cope with this harassment and must weigh up his life and the difficulties of pursuing his dream and whether it is worth it or not the whole premise of a talented individual seeking greatness or whos entire existence seems devoted to success is a welltrodden one however this film sees the footprints that other films have made and chooses to walk in a different direction instead of stepping in the impressions already made most films of the like seem to think ambition and obsession of this nature as a bad thing that corrupts the soul but in whiplash that is clearly not the message it shows us that the strive for greatness is always painful arduous and poisonous and leaves us wondering if its worth it however at the same time it also shows the benefits of overcoming this adversity and the sense of satisfaction and meaning it can give to yougreat art is often born out of great pain and whiplash shows this in the bluntest fashion possible it is terrifying but it is also incredibly inspirationali kept drawing comparisons to black swan when watching this film and although i feel that black swan is still a good film i feel that whiplash achieves a deeper broader and greater meaning than this albeit similar film black swan is often melodramatic basic in aspects of its story its themes and its imagery and id say pretentious in many ways it thinks its smarter or deeper than it really is whiplash is a really grounded story it delivers perfect tension consistently throughout the film i thought there would be large lulls in between important scenes but it proves to be an uncomfortable in a good way watch from start to finish whiplash explores the relationship of the mentor and the protagonist expertly and manages to expose positives and negatives in each character that gives you a rather confused and unsettled opinion on both again in a good way it manages to avoid tired clichés like the suffocating family figure who plants their failed dreams into their children black swan etc in whiplash it seems like andrew is seeking attention and recognition from his family who have little to do with his life as a performer which is an entirely different situation it doesnt touch the idea that despite my success i dont find satisfaction raging bull etc instead it revels in the moments were andrew is able to achieve a victory which inches him closer to his goal a major commendation has to go to the direction which is able to capture the frantic scenes unfold deftly it is incredibly difficult to capture such frantic movements on that drum set in a way that is digestible and enthralling to the audience tension is hard to capture and chazelle manages to relish bottling it up the music is great of course as youd expect where i will criticise this film is to justify my view that it is overrated in its high ranking on the top 250 the lead performance by miles teller is good very good but its not an exceptional performance thats incredibly memorable its what id call a generically good performance which is not a bad thing but just that he doesnt stand out against the leads of the films around whiplash youd think of marty mcfly or maximus decimus meridius before andrew im sure i actually found natalie portmans oscar winning role in black swan to be superior if i am being honest which may be surprising to the reader of this review jk simmons is the star of the film in my eyes and is indeed a very memorable and nuanced performance i am not surprised in the slightest to learn of his oscar win that year however this is a typical simmons role that is playing to his strengths and isnt what id call transformative although this is by far his best and one of the best portrayals of this type of character which is certainly due to the great script quite simply i will say this is a great film in every aspect people might say that my criticism in my previous paragraph is unfair and perhaps that is true you could describe this film as a band itself you could have one very talented musicianactor who steals the show but if all the others in the bandproduction dont play their part then its worth nought whilst no individual aspect of this film is truly exceptional the way that everything comes together to make a great film is perhaps the best compliment anyone can really give a film

austin powers films we will get to that later austin powers in goldmember is a disappointing finale if the trilogy does come to an end this movie is susceptible to what i like to call bowtie endings in which all the characters are happy everything falls into place and the masses are pleased with no clear cut solution pity just when i thought the film would bring closure to a great little idea it falters at a tremendous rate this being said please allow me the admittance of describing the feeling for such harsh opening remarks for the third installment of a once venerable franchise the first austin powers film was a little gem that film literally came out of nowhere and gained its following on video cassette after a paltry box office upon the sequel the same feel and excitement was elevated after the creative team knew they had to come up something fresh and they did for those who follow the films the tone was set in the second film after a great opening sequence displayed the many abuses the male genitalia can undergo in the third installment all the energy runs dry after a hilarious cameo packed action sequence sets the running gag for the film within a film concept once we are pleasantly surprised by whom mike myers and the rest of the team can assemble for cameo appearances we are thwarted into vintage austin powers territory as the musical introductory sequence occurs unfortunately not all the cameos in the world could save a deplorable and uncreative musical sequence that sets the tone for a heavily choreographed mildly funny film that solemnly brings closure to the franchisemike myers returns as the heroic austin powers he also returns as the villainous dr evil and the evil henchman fat bastard amidst all the characters the creators have decided to throw in another character who is supposed to be from holland yet has a freakishly accent reminiscent of new jersey the aptly named goldmember has an affinity for all things gold and he is supposed to be the driving force behind the evil schemes yet his character is completetly futile in terms of plot development and those who saw the film know there isnt even any closure to this character the question arises will there be another austin powers film if it is as recycled as this film was many will take a pass at it some may be asking by this point why so harsh it is very simple avid fans who have come to know and love the immortal austin powers character know the man behind the character mike myers is a very talented and creative man insiders have always claimed many of the intuitive ideas were spawned from myers and his thorough involvement within the script contributed to the success of the two films alas this cannot be said for the third as aforementioned from the musical introductory sequence a morbid feeling came rushing over me as if to say have they already used up all their ideas yes they have director jay roach meet the parents austin powers returns to helm the third installment in what proves to be a disappointing foray into comedy roach tries his best at simply running the camera as many of the skits seem to be strictly improvised grounded in about a couple of sentences of script the key word is skit this film lacks cohesiveness due to a complete omission of plot the film mentions something about kidnapping austin powers father sir micheal caine and having goldmember destroy the world the gags have all been done before and this time the audience is laughing at recycled elements from the first two films thrown into a pot this film is like a best of gag reel and amalgamates all the best elements of the first two films and brings them together it is simply a running skit of gags that in terms of story do not contribute to one another remember the shadow scene from the second film it is here remember the rivalry between dr evil and his son scott it is here too remember the sequence where they get around saying a graphic word by alluding to it by spotting things in the sky a la hot dog skit in the second film it is here alsospunk and creativity are lacking as the film takes on an uncomfortable tone of dismal classiness the first two were funny raunchy and wholesome films this film will guarantee you many laughs but when the film is over one will be asking themselves what they were laughing about it is that exact mindlessness that works against the film so many times there were scenes that did not elicit laughs from the audience yet they were still included in the final cut a lot of little bits in the film did not work it seemed like a bad high school variety show at some points but they were still in the film it is inexplicable when there are uncomfortable pauses within in a comedy something is incorrect adding to the demise of the film is beyonce knowles a singer who makes her acting debut as foxxy cleopatra a hybrid of shaft and jackie brown all rolled into one her character is endlessly annoying and is simply present to prompt awareness about austins biracial preferences in any event the film will elicit many laughs merely due to the immaturity of the jokes and the recycled cliches brought together will it leave the viewer with a dire need to watch it again as in the first two films sadly no this time austin is not shagadelicgiancarlos rating ',\n",

              " 'george lucas has finally proved himself worthy of the legacy of star wars with revenge of the sith mr lucas has proved that he can actually direct a great movie revenge of the sith manages to successfully and satisfyingly close the star wars circle the saga is finally completemany star wars fans myself included were disappointed with george lucas when he made the first two prequels episode i the phantom menace and episode ii attack of the clones we felt that he ruined the charm and the magic of the original trilogy episodes iv v and vi a new hope the empire strikes back and return of the jedi respectively while nobody really goes to star wars to see great acting the acting in the prequels especially by those who played anakin jake lloyd in phantom menace and hayden christensen in attack of the clones and also by natalie portman who played padme was below any real level of tolerance the fact that natalie portman is normally a good actress proves that the problem with the prequels was the director and not the actors the script was uneven and georges pathetic attempt at writing romantic scenes in attack of the clones was so pathetic it was embarrassing george also ruined some favorite star wars lore the force became a scientific matter medichlorians and r2d2 and c3p0 became the sources of comic relief thus completely ruining their characters c3p0s oneliners in attack of the clones were so bad it hurt we all asked ourselves what was george thinking well with revenge of the sith we understand that george asked himself the exact same thingrevenge of the sith is so much better than the previous two prequels its amazing everything in it is better ill start with the least important the special effects the opening shot of the movie totally blew me away youll know what im talking about when you see it many people complained about the way the cgi yoda looked in attack of the clones and i also thought that he wasnt a really amazing achievement in cgi in revenge of the sith the animators have clearly taken some more classes and yoda looks perfect who would have thought that a 2foothigh green cgi character could look so believable and he really does the character of general grievous is brilliantly executed if youre a special effects fan prepare to be completely blown away whats so overwhelming about this though is that while the movie is built with the special effects it doesnt rely on them its not built around them they are used as tools to create the visuals of the star wars universe they are second to the plot and to the drama and thats one of the reasons that revenge of the sith is so successfulthe acting has improved by far natalie portman finally proves to all star wars fans that she can in fact act and she acts wonderfully in this movie the true shining star though is ian mcdiarmid who plays palpatine powerfully with ruthless supremacy bordering insanitythe films single biggest flaw is the casting of hayden christensen as anakin skywalker episode ii was too flawed to really notice haydens bad acting but in episode iii it stands out and really drags the film down this is especially unfortunate because of the intensity of the film and his character intensity that is brought down because of his actingthe true crowning achievement of revenge of the sith though is the drama it sounds strange saying this but revenge of the sith is actually emotional i was totally engaged in the drama its not all drama though theres plenty of action but the scenes with the jedi especially with palpatine or anakin and obiwan are really tense and powerful the emotion in this film is something that hasnt been seen in star wars since the dramatic scenes between luke and vader in the empire strikes back their intensity can definitely be compared to those very scenes anakins decline towards the dark side is portrayed so brilliantly and dramatically that you really feel for him feel his and his loved ones pain star wars once again becomes a true cinematic experience and not just a bunch of special effectsand despite the drama there still is some of that good old star wars fun the difference is that with this movie george isnt painfully trying to create cool things on the screen yoda fighting count dooku in attack of the clones wasnt really important after all the fight ended quickly and unresolved it was put in just because george knew that people would think that seeing yoda fighting would be cool the same goes for r2d2 flying with the jets on his legs in revenge of the sith george doesnt show any of these things only because of their entertainment value yoda fights because hes fighting for his life r2d2 uses his jet packs as a tool not as a way to show off his coolness it seems that georges attitude towards the film has completely changed from his attitude towards the other two prequelsany star wars fan and hopefully thats all of you will be delighted while and after watching the film because of all the reasons mentioned above but also because its such a thrill watching as all the loose ends are tied and all the pieces of the puzzle fit in perfectly with the beginning of the original trilogy starting from episode ivall in all star wars episode iii is a total success from george lucas who managed to end the saga with an impressive and glorious bang and if you manage to look over the feeble dialog and the wooden acting youll see that its actually a really good movie',\n",

effects3 adding in new characters you dont care about and in worse cases omitting major characters to the detriment to the sequelthe first smashhit was a good movie because it was essentially an rrated cokedup riff of those roger mooreera james bond flicks that still boasted a solid story it was an rrated ultraviolent spy kidsso going into this followup i thought there was a good chance this sequel would at least match the quality of the first movie given this is the first sequel that matthew vaughn has directed kickass 2 was directed by jeff wadlow and xmen days of future past was bryan singerobviously the action never reaches the heights of the free birdsoundtracked church sequence from the first oh boy do they try but there are a few highlights the movie opens with a great car chase with eggsy egerton fighting a winter soliderized charlie hesketh the explanation for how he survived the first movie admittedly makes no sense soundtracked to lets go crazy by prince that really starts the movie off with bangthere are also plenty of damn funny moments too including one involving a gps tracker that literally had everybody in the audience rolling on the flooreven though this sequel is far from devoid of entertainment value it still disappointingly suffers from all three of the sequelitis issues that ive highlighted above and it is all rooted in the script which essentially boils down to a retread of the first movie with much more fatoh boy does this movie have way too much fat with its excessive number of characters and severe pacing issues for some reason the filmmakers thought it was a good idea to place even more focus on eggsy which perplexes the heck out of me because eggsy has always been the most boring character in this seriestoo much of this movie is taken up by his relationshipdrama with his swedish princess girlfriend aka eggsy butt victory present at the end of the first one that is played perplexingly straight and only serves to grind the whole affair to a halt i also love how eggsy is supposed to have matured since the first movie yet is still somehow dumb enough to leave the door to the secret spy room in his apartment place completely unlockedthe dialogue scenes between galahad and merlin strong are one of the few times where the movie sincerely succeeds in injecting an emotional core probably the most effecting moment in the whole film comes at the end with mark strong if you have seen the movie you know what im talking about its ironic that for a movie with so much special effects and action the best scene is a simple one that climaxes with one tiny explosionthe movie in general spends way too much time with superfluous uninteresting elements ex eggsy girlfriend a gratuitous running gag with elton john that overstays its welcome and not enough on the actual interesting elements ex the touching dynamic between eggsy and galahad the satire on drug use that should have been more of the main focuseven the statesman which were a centerpiece in the films marketing end up being completely superfluous to the plot channing tatum fans will be severely disappointed because he only has a total of 10 minutes of total screen time before being unceremoniously removed from the plot even halle berry and jeff bridges are barely in the movie and thus do not make much of an impressionthe only statesman to receive any significant screentime is pedro pascal who plays jack daniels aka the one with the whip now i really like pascal especially on narcos and he does a good job with the role and has a good chemistry with main trio of kingsman but as with the case with most things with this movie jack daniels doesnt really add much to the narrative and mostly exists to squeeze in more action sequences his last fight scene is a classic case of padding out he does have an intriguing character reveal but its frustratingly tacked unto the eleventh hour of the storythis is a movie in which the filmmakers seemed to have been very much thinking in set pieces which isnt always a bad thing ex john wick mad max fury road but if that is the route you are gonna take with your action movie\\x85then please keep the pacing brisk and invention constant it is never a good sign when action sequences start coming off as a boring nuisances than thrilling and the nearly two and ahalf hour runtime does not help mattersprobably the biggest weakness of this movie is surprisingly its main villain despite a solid introduction you will not look at a hamburger the same way again the 50s obsessed drug lord poppy adams moore comes off as more of an annoyance to our heroes than an actual threat she lacks that seamless balance of odd humor and sincere menace that samuel l jackson brought in the first onemoores overly ernest dialogue delivery and just the fact that most of the jokes written for her are lame contribute to her character getting annoying and old very fast moore is a very good actress but her performance was simply terribleso at the end of the day ktgc ended up just being another average sequel if you loved that first movie then i can only recommend it as a rental but otherwise stick with the original',\n",

              " 'let me first explain the reasoning behind the title of this review it is hard for me to find the negatives in movies if i enjoy a movie then i enjoy a movie plain and simple i am also not a very picky i have only seen this film once but everything is mostly still in my head personal bias hopefully aside lets begin spoiler freeid like to start with the few minor disappointments i had with spectrewritings on the wall by sam smith each theme for every bond movie is just as crucial to the film as everything else and in spectres case i found it rather unfitting the visuals i thought were beautiful during the opening theme featuring animations of octopi but the song itself just seemed off maybe it was the lyrics or the melody itself i just found it slightly distracting minor minor disappointment heremore 007 bond theme another minor disappointment here the james bond theme as iconic as it is was not featured as much as id normally like not to say the score was bad because it was in fact fantastic the bond theme was present in the beginning of the film and at the end as well but i would have liked to see it used more in the various action scenes throughout the film not necessarily in every one but enough to where it is not overplayed the james bond theme music honestly can be synced with any seen and could have been utilized more in spectre formal element breakdown scoresacting i have never had a problem with acting when it comes to bond films and spectra does not fall short at all daniel craig continues to deliver a masterful performance as james bond that viewers have grown to love it was surely a treat as well to see christoph waltz as a bond villain i loved the fact that for half the film he was kept in the shadows very fitting of his character although we missed seeing judi dench play m in the film ralph fiennes filled the shoes quite nicely a more personal side of both moneypenny and q are evident in the film as well both getting more screen time mr hinx played by dave bautista was a nice touch as well so what he doesnt talk much would you the return of jesper christensen as mr white was stellar and finally lea seydoux as the bond girl her acting was fantastic as well i enjoyed the differently styled approach to her character as well at first she does not seem like a bond girl which adds a unique quality to her character score 1010cinematographylighting cinematographer hoyte van hoytema has quite the resume of films hes shot as he was dop for interstellar and her to name a few spectra continues the trend of skyfall being shot so beautifully one of my favorite sequences of images is the opening scene which plays out with no cuts its a master shot and is simply brilliant in its execution of opening the film it provides a sense of excitement as viewers are taken on a ride through crowds of people and buildings id love to cover everything scene by scene but i will focus on my favorites scenes showing off landscape for example when bond is traveling to mr whites house in the mountains are stunning the aerial shots of the train stunning cityscape stunning the film is lit so well creating the much needed demand for dramatic light for bond films the perfect combination of light and shadows are used whether its concealing the identity of oberhauser or setting the mood for each scene action sequences are also done very well creating suspense with the fast paced actions and cuts even the dark scenes with minimal lighting look simply fantastic score 1010editingsound the editing itself was great nothing special but an accomplished job nonetheless the special effects were super cool so many nifty explosions from buildings to cars some of which are a first time use in a bond film sound design is great as it always is for a bond film tracks are mixed nicely dialogue is clean any sign of adr is not noticed at all the music and sound effects add so much to the film as they do for every film ever but do a great job at adding emotionfeeling to the film i already noted my minor problems in this category above as a reminder score 9510story spectre surprisingly found a way to tie all of daniel craigs bond films together and i thought this was amazing some people will disagree with me but in todays world of cinema tying films together has been an ongoing trend lately especially with the marvel cinematic universedc comics to name a few the script offers some great oneliners for comedic relief and provides viewers with hopes and fears for each character overall i enjoyed the plot it was familiar territory you know ties to past films and i enjoyed the new take of the organization known as spectre the only problem i had with the plot was this we know what spectre is doing but we dont really know why theyre doing or what will happen if they succeed we know exactly what bond is trying to accomplish but not necessarily for spectre nonetheless i liked the story a lot not as much as skyfall or casino royale but definitely up there score 8510final verdict im not sure what some of the fuss is all about but i have seen them all and love this one all the more seeing it as another great step for the james bond franchise as well for daniel craigs career final score 9510 superior must seethanks for reading',\n",

              " 'last week i watched a serbian film in its uncut form i made the decision to watch the film despite reviews cautioning me against its extreme content for multiple reasons primarily because i am not squeamish when it comes to film i was certain i could take whatever these filmmakers threw at me and because i was curious to see how any film could possibly elicit such a visceral reaction among even those who have not seen it not to mention its audienceso having seen a serbian film what can i say about it to those of you who might be thinking of watching this film for yourselves perhaps for the same reasons i watched it first let me assure you that the reviews of a serbian film here and elsewhere dont begin to scratch the surface of this films depravity yes this film depicts both incest and child rape but these moments of the film horrific as they are were hardly the worst of this films atrocities as they either take place offscreen or are otherwise left to the imaginationmore distressing to me at least are the many elements of a serbian film wherein the filmmakers marry sex and violence in the most brutal graphic ways imaginable the most barbaric of these include a man raping and then ejaculating on the body of a woman whom he has just beheaded a man using his penis to suffocate a woman who cannot bite down on him as she gasps for air because her teeth have been ripped out and one man killing another by shoving his erect penis so far into his victims empty eyesocket yes really that it actually penetrates his brain so if youre curious about a serbian film as i was or if youre wondering if its really all that bad heres your answer a serbian film is not merely just as bad as you might have heard it is so revolting so inhumane and so utterly without merit that the film can serve only as an insult to those of us who believe in both freedom of speech and artistic expression indeed i am thankful this film was not more widely exhibited because given our current political climate a serbian film would probably be enough to convince a great many people that if this film is the product of freedoms such as these we might actually be better off without themone last thing please do not be deceived as i was into thinking that this film has a point that makes it worth watching through to the end even once by those critics who have argued that the film is somehow thematically brilliant depending on whose review youre reading this films brutality is excusable because the filmmakers are working to illustrate either that the serbian people are raped by the serbian powers that be from the moment theyre born until the moment they die or that serbian film itself is being brutalized by those who purport to love it regardless of what these filmmakers might have been trying to say the fact is that they fail miserably no matter which of these purportedly meaningful readings of the film one tries to impose upon it make this a film about the helplessness of the serbian people and you somehow have to explain away among other things the fact that milos is not forced against his will into appearing in this serbian film rather he agrees to appear in the film in exchange for a significant sum of money and remains even after it becomes clear to him that the film will require him to participate in the rape and murder of innocent women and children for this reason among others the narrative of the film itself makes this reading of the film impossible to justifyand what of those whove read this film as a commentary on the sad state of serbian film itself which had been heavily censored by the government for years thats just ridiculous to protest the censorship of serbian films by making this serbian film makes about as much sense as protesting gun control legislation by machinegunning the husbands wives and children of the people responsible for it this film doest argue against censorship it makes a good case for censorshipi can only presume that these and other similarly meaningful readings of a serbian film are the result of critical attempts to superimpose some kind of statement upon this film that could possibly justify its content but there is no justification for this film or its content a serbian film is an utterly meaningless anthology of the most savage inhumane sexual perversions imaginable strung together via a loosely structured narrative into a 104minute cinematic assault that serves only to degrade all who watch it and nothing moreat the conclusion of a serbian film i put my copy of the film where i think it best belonged in my shredder and while i am no fan of censorship if i had the means to do so i would track down and destroy every copy of this film ever made and then have the people responsible for it arrested and tried for crimes against humanity such is the depth of my loathing for both this film and those who made it and if my words here today do anything at all to prevent the spread of this cinematic virus to even one more person then as far as im concerned the time ive dedicated to this review will have been very well spent indeed',\n",

body and throws them into an overgrown field the ghost of a cute young girl appears and takes the hand of a healthy clean version of the boy who just passed away the movie cuts and we see them taking a train to a better land it is made obvious right in the beginning that both characters die this leads some people to say well whats the point of watching we know what happens in the end thats not the point of the movie the point of the movie is to show the story of these two young children struggling through difficult lives while there is hope for a happy ending we hope that the characters have easy pain free lives its the same idea for us we all know we will eventually die but we try to make our lives as easy and pain free as we canthis movie breaks the stereotype of oh this movie is animated so yeah while it might be moving its going to stay within safe confines this is usually the case because animation is seen as a childish medium which is why so many kids movies are animated while these kids movies might have moving scenes and teach valuable lessons as i said earlier its going to stay within safe confines this movie can easily be mentioned in the same breath as other great war movies such as saving private ryan schindlers list and full metal jacket its just a beautiful piece of art thats moving and powerful but it just happens to be animatedthis movie conveys a very powerful antiwar message without completely shoving the idea down your throat it tells the non sugar coated story of two young children made homeless and struggling to survive after air raids in world war ii although the characters are fictional its based on the true story of the writer of the graphic novel the movie is based off of akiyuki nosaka its obvious that director isao takahata resents the war but he provides a strong anti war message without forty minutes of bloody gory violence believe it or not there are still children who live this way nowadays we just dont see it on the newsvery few movies can make me genuinely care for a character in this case you do care for the characters in the movie you hope for the best for these two innocent children in most movies nowadays you see young characters acting much older than they really are we all know that movie with the four year old character thats sassy smart and mature but in this movie thats not the case at all setsuko acts like a four year old in real life would act and her role is executed to near perfection from her motions to her dialogue you see can see very clearly the four year old in her as for seita his role is executed greatly as well he makes the mistakes a fourteen year old boy in that situation probably would his mindset is that of a fourteen year old his decisions which are sometimes good and sometimes bad are that of a fourteen year old the beautiful thing about this movie is when seita makes mistakes you understand it because you know that everybody makes mistakes because were human the character development in this movie is also top notch we see seita go from a normal teenager with a positive outlook on life to a poverty stricken teenager with still a positive outlook on life but now he realizes how much his sister really means to him we see setsuko go from a happy sweet innocent four year old girl to a confused poverty stricken malnourished childthe next point i would like to touch on is the appearance and the effects for this movie the animation in this movie is an art its stunning the animation shows the setting in a way that real life movies just cant from the urban environments to the fields and rivers of the wild the animation is beautifully done the next thing is the soundtrack i dont have much to say about it but they used music very well they used music very sparingly and when they did use it they used it at perfect timesto me the theme of this movie is friendship love and caring for others its love story but not hollywood style members of the opposite sex attracted to each other looking for love in a romantic sense in this movie its more brotherly love the movie makes you aware of how good your life is compared to some people around the world it made me aware of my sometimes selfish ways it made me think about all the times in my life where i had the opportunity to help people but i didnt it makes me realize how much i take my sister for granted and how fleeting life can be one day youre just fine and the next day you can be struggling to survive most of all it made me realize that life can slip away from you any moment and to live every day like its youre lastin conclusion grave of the fireflies is a very beautiful movie that succeeds in ways some american war movies simply dont it teaches you so many valuable lessons its one of the most underrated movies of all time its one of the few movies that changed my life and one of the few movies that had me holding back tears at the end this is a must see movie that will change your life 1010 one of the most moving beautiful movies of all time',\n",

it is only good for the effects these people are surprisingly common trust me do not listen they just want to tear down something that so many people love because they are wannabe critics you really have to see this one in 3d or the front row of imax in order to get the full experience but you feel like you are in space while watching it especially in 3d this film is absolutely unbelievable the effects are breathtaking the music shatteringly climactic and the acting compelling i just cant say more about this film other than the fact that it takes a simple tale of survival and adds so much drama and action to it if you want character development that is said through longwinded dialogue and takes the whole film watch the godfather this film is able to show us who these people are and get us to care enough that we do not want to see them die an excruciating death in the airless vacuum of outer space without spending time telling us what we already know yeah i know character development is important but we already have this development and any more would just hinder the films pacing while it is true that george clooney pretty much just plays suave george clooney in a spacesuit a lot of these moronic critics argue that george clooneys character was too calm in case they didnt know nasa only selects the very best people to be astronauts look up how astronauts actually react in a crisis they stay calm so they can figure a way out of it ryan stone was not an astronaut she was a medical engineer that invented a scanning device used on the hubble space telescope it is stated clearly in the film that this was her first time in space and she had only been there for a week so naturally she would be freaking out sorry but these people find stuff to criticize and they cannot do it right of course i would have done certain things differently such as having the entire movie take place in the vacuum rather than space stations but i suppose things had to keep moving for the sake of fluent pacing not that i blame the filmmakers for this but the film could have been a lot more terrifying than it turned out to be the film seemed to run on more things going wrong at an alarming rate rather than the slow terrifyingly impending doom i was expecting again not that this is a bad thing i just see a different way to make a space film darker and more unforgiving and hope to do this somedaythis is a film so complex and breathtaking that it must be seen to be believed the details are intricate and loving every time i learn more about this film i find something new to adore the fact that the writers were inspired by spielberg masterpieces like duel and jaws to create a compelling film that took place in a single location or the fact that the entire film was intricately choreographed since the actors were literally acting in front of a green screen just makes me wonder how complex it must have been to make this film and do you know what that tells me that tells me that the filmmakers cared they actually wanted to work hard to do a risky gamble of a film just because they wanted to do something that had not been done before to fulfill their visions i cant imagine pitching this to a studio which just gives me more respect for how this film was put together the 3d is stunning and surprisingly doesnt exploit the use of 3d technology this is coming from the guy who hates anything 3d lets face it it was a stupid cheap gimmick back then and its a stupid expensive gimmick now but not for gravity this film uses 3d as a tool to get you invested and make you feel like you are there most 3d films just sell themselves out for cheap shots of things coming at the camera obnoxiously to constantly remind you that the film is in 3d not gravity this film is far too classy for thatalfonso cuaron once said that most movies can be seen with your eyes cosed and you will hear the entire film this is one of the major reasons he wanted to see a picture like gravity to show people how it felt to see the very first movie in a nickelodeon that movies dont have to be just passable entertainment movies can be an experience that requires many of the senses to truly respect and understand this film is living proof that cinema isnt dead if future films are as great as gravity there is a hell of a lot more to look forward to time magazine once said that gravity shows us the glory of cinemas future since the only good films to come out in the last decade or so are childrens films or films that were based on true events or books films didnt take a lot of creativity to come up with so i wholly agree with time gravity is a film that dared to show us something we had never seen before even if no more films come out that dare to do something different and put effort into something that isnt a boring remake or derivative drama i can just keep watching gravity with hope restored that filmmakers in the future still careand thats just fine with me go

of the most stylish and innovative films to come out of hollywood to date the graphic mind of frank miller with the candyviolence ways of rodriguez coupled together created an undeniable force of creativity and passion that continually lack in the overbudgeted hollywood films i have read several reviews that boast the cinematography of this film as being way before its time thus the apparent lack of support at the box office but while i did think the way that rodriguez filmed this movie was outstanding i thought that it was more than just a visual treat everyone in this film seemed to be giving more than what i bargained for from the direction to the actors to even the darkened themes that resonated loudly throughout the film sin city was perfection to they eye but also in every other critiquing categorywhat captivated me more than the visual eyecandy was the overall story of sin city rodriguez and miller both chose to keep the original narrative from the graphic novels to help tell the story that they had filmed not only did it help us get from point a to point b of the story but it also helped us learn about the characters without the indecent flashback or long speeches i learned more about the inside of marvs mind through the battles that he was having with himself than with any other technique that could have been used i think that brings me to another reason this film worked on more levels than anticipated because i knew the characters this is a character driven story while they to commit graphic scenes of violence it is the characters that literally steal the show i can only think of a handful of films mostly wes anderson movies where i felt like the characters were the central focus not explosions or sex while these things surrounded our characters it was the characters the strength of the actors that kept my eyes on the screencontinuing with the story one cannot help but be impressed with the consistency in millers stories the overall themes of each of the stories while told in different voices and situations were all the same the theme of love lust and revenge seemed to follow all of our characters around the city and surprisingly it worked i was never more impressed to see the same themes reworked over and over love is huge in this film each character has a passion or a love for someone else which drives them to the brink of madness with each characters love followed a moment of revenge if you look at all three stories the main narrators are fighting for someone that they love to bring justice to those that did this one person wrong revenge is a dish best served cold they say but in the case of millers pen he serves it hot and heavy finally there is a moment of truth with each of the stories i didnt realize this until i had spent several days thinking about this film but in each of millers stories we are not shown the full truth it is a one sided story where we see the action through the eyes of the main narrator we are only shown one truth instead of jumping back and forth between good and evil i really liked this because it created a sense of distrust in sin city were the guys that we were cheering for really the good in the equation or were they just all elements that created the chaos known as sin city marvs story in particular exemplifies this idea his blurred vision of reality resonated through me as the film continued to the other stories and made me question several of the endings think about this when you see it again and possibly again and again because remember the title of this film is sin city those that reside in it are not always the good in the good vs evil equationfinally and i know i have mentioned it already above but i want to honestly put it aside from everything else i would like to recognize the caliber of acting that came from our actors here we have the best in the industry proving that they can handle the pressures of a huge budget yet also place 100 of their heart into a smaller scale their ability to create this noirstyled picture and stay with the style created back in the 40s was impressive the 40s released some of my favorite films and these actors paid a huge homage to them some will argue that the dialogue is choppy and humorously bad at times but i say that you need to explore some of the 40s crime noir films and see that they are just building on an already beautiful structure everyone involved in this film was outstanding i cannot think of one character that i disliked or thought could have done better i think it is the fact that i have to give

praise it was a passable movie with solid acting but too many loose ends to make the whole experience satisfying yet this director made the extraordinary achievement to have two movies in a row nominated in all four major categories which has never been done since reds in 1981 ill check silver linings playbook soon but from what i discovered in american hustle what stands for great acting is the capability to act weird and over the top while in super disco disguises well then give a honorary oscar to the wardrobe and thatll be enoughbut the film is supposed to be a comedyand im sorry but it is not obvious that the film is a comedy as a matter of fact the tone of the story goes all over the map and you cant really figure out whether it tries to be a lighthearted contale or some multilayered character study if its a comedy in the sense that we shouldnt take it seriously well that doesnt say much about the film but it could have been both funny and serious this is not the hardest stunt a film can achieve especially with a good script but david orussell goes in too many directions for the films own good in the end too many scenes too many improvisations too many jump cuts and cheap turns and twists made the experience of watching the film extremely disorienting speaking for myself just when i started to get emotionally hooked to amy adams sydney and her chemistry with christian bales rosenfeld there had to be the character played by jennifer lawrence popping up and getting increasingly important in the plot and this sassy bitch obviously meant as a comic relief would even get on freuds nerves as if it wasnt messy enough youve got someone whos obviously not part of the solution and keeps on nagging and shouting well if thats supposed to be funny just give me drama and dont get me started on the live and let die part i know the music is an inevitable element when you make a period piece and on that level orussel has a pretty good taste in music but music feels like noises superposed to other noises not just a background now it is obvious that this is a wannabe goodfellas and casino but it turns a rather banal scheme into something of labyrinthine complexity just to milk the acting of the four stars and justify the awards nominations im pretty sure that each of these characters were interesting on their own but in terms of effects they all cancel each other we cant individually root for them since they all spend their time acting like jerks trying to outsmart each other and win the quirkiest character contest if you make a film about swindlers a minimum of likability is vital otherwise to the degree that youll start to understand whats going on you wont really care for the outcome its not about having likable characters as morally right but providing enough perspective on their lives so you ca genuinely care for them and this is why goodfellas or the sting are still acclaimed masterpieces first these films are easier to follow without being less complex than american hustle but more than that you have a clear view on henry hills backstory and you see why hooker wants to get lonnegan in american hustle we have to assume that irvin and sidney had no other options in their lives and that rosalyn was actually smarter than her husband the film asks us to take many things for granted which could have been possible if the editing wasnt so deliberately chaotic its a pity because some parts were nothing short of cinematic brilliance i for one thing loved the friendship subplot between carmine renner and bale culminating with that funny oven scene and its very revealing that the only one who didnt get any award buzz was renner the one who played a straight and realistic character its like acting was elevated to some carnival level all the others were just dressed as if they were invited to a 70s themed party and spent their time shouting and overacting amy adams being the constant subject to an obvious fetishist cameraman while babyfaced lawrence was forcing herself to convince us she was some mature thirtysomething woman and i know many directors have their darlings but it was too distracting to see the same actors again playing again for the same director no matter how chameleonic or versatile they are it is distracting renner was the good thing about the film so was bale to a certain extent and the last twenty minutes were good but not as emotionally rewarding as they should have been if the rest of the film matched that quality maybe theres something to blame on the directing editing or storytelling or maybe im an idiot who doesnt get the brilliance of orussell but there was a similar film directed the same year a conominee named the wolf of wall street it was a wannabe goodfellas too but as hitchcock would say selfplagiarizing is style and theres another thing that gives the edge to wolf it focused on one main character and two supporting ones and leo was the pillar the film could get over the top it never lost its focus orussell wanted to pull a scorsese stylewise but its like he was intoxicated by the exuberance of his characters and the flashiness of the 70s setting that he convinced the world this was a masterpiece is perhaps more fascinating than the titular hustle',\n",

huge debt for i genuinely believe that the 1980s were the worst decade in history for the modern motion picture the high concept pitching of films that could be summed up literally in two lines with functional dialogue and a to b plotting had caused a serious slump in creative output and audiences were being patronised by what substandard fare was being pumped into the cinemasin 1992 quentin entered the scene with reservoir dogs 9 okay its heavily indebted to foreign film but the realtimetimebending conceits of the movie coupled with naturalistic dialogue that gave characterisation broke down the rot okay films with plot and character were all the rage in the 60s 70s 50s even but the 80s had forgotten how to do it and quentin gave it back to us now im sure everyone could tell me theres another film writerdirector that did it first but quentin was the one to popularise it he capitalised on dogs with the more commercial more indulgent more juvenile but ultimately much more fun pulp fiction 10 without these films we would never have seen such fare as the usual suspects with its wordy script and timebending and this would never have bled on to the dying british film scene with movies like the successful trainspotting there were other successes too such as by far and away the greatest tarantino film not directed by tarantino true romance 7 starring christian slater who allegedly gives 10 in royalties to jack nicholson for every performance it lost the downbeat ending and time distortions but quentin was said to be satisfied with the linear narrative of this 93 movie his first real film script discounting an incomplete student project my best friends birthday it was completed in 1987 and went for years before being taken up it showcased some of his best dialogue and hollywood satire tony scotts more laidback direction actually giving greater chance for the writing to shine and for a film that also features dennis hopper christopher walken brad pitt val kilmer gary oldman and balki out of perfect strangers it didnt feel crammed amazingly i still know of people that wont see it as they think by the title that its a romantic comedyhowever the nature of the films and the fact that tarantino did so much in so little time meant a backlash wasnt only inevitable but in certain quarters eagerly awaited experimental betweenfilm follies such as four rooms didnt help and when jackie brown emerged three years after pulp fiction it seemed as if his time had passed jackie brown 7 was a smoother maturer direction for tarantino the first of his films not to come from his own ideas but from a source text elmore leonards rum punch it was a new direction interestingly aged 15 quentin had been caught trying to unsuccessfully hustle a copy of leonards the switch from a shopping mall many of his previous films did use the oft touted magpie technique of borrowing ringo lams city of fire has often been brought up in conversation against reservoir dogs and the butch segment of pulp fiction was a reworked version of roger killing zoe avarys pandemonium reigned yet this was a fullyfledged adaptation miramax having bought him the rights to four leonard novels in 1995 the other three being killshot bandits and freaky deaky quentins original plan was to make killshot starring himself bruce willis and holly hunterof course many dont appreciate a film that has in its range robert deniro yet underuses him and samuel l jackson who is given plenty to say but nothing as incendiary as ezekiel 2517 there is only one timebreak where a single scene is played out three times in the same bracket and only one kitsch moment where an animated plane is used to paper the gaps in a 5 millionhigherthanpulpfictionbutstillverylow 13 million budget violence is almost nonexistent by qs standards and the subjects discussed range not from burger bars to the fantastic four but the fear of ageing and the delphonics top of the bill is a longterm idol of quentins pam grier who is even namechecked in reservoir dogs its an altogether more relaxed more controlled film and in many ways the writing is stronger the easy option of a sketchstyle format for his script is discarded making it in a sense a better film yet people claim it to be worse strange a genuinely touching romance at times the only comment this one got was its nothing compared to reservoir dogs and pulp fiction quentin it seems is a victim of his own successand so it is that we now await his fourth writerdirector vehicle another leonard piece 40 lashes fingers are crossed that it will a superb return to form though maybe it doesnt really matter even if quentins time were over he would still have achieved a widescale revitalisation of american cinema however it would be fortunate if 40

then there are the craig era knob slobbers who pop up to state how its the best bond ever usually saying that its as good or better than the bar they have set which is casino royale however anybody over 30 knows that there are over 20 fantastic other series entries to measure it against if comparecontrast reviewing is your bag i can easily say that skyfall is neither the best nor worst james bond entry id put it in the lower middle of the canon the good an overly choreographed drawn out and over hyped video game like opening extended chase scene morphs into one of the most colorful title sequences in the entire series which set to adeles extremely well sung title theme song makes it the highlight of the film the aston martin is back although for no logical reason other than nostalgia it aint exactly the vehicle of choice for the moors of scotland the phrase bond james bond is back and so are a couple of welcome one liners although craig is nowhere near as adept at saying them as well any of the other bonds the villains kept woman is a very sexy bond girl the villains island was a nice change of pace locale a male m returns maybe well see some of the good old m vs bond one ups again instead of the feminist mother complex trash weve been subjected to since the 90s the bad cgi komodo dragons pathetic a potentially suspenseful moment where bond hangs from a bar beneath a moving elevator was totally blown by having craig simply pop off with no difficulty the hows he gonna get out of this one suspense question was answered like a z grade serial cliffhanger cheat there were only two bond girls one of which turns out to be moneypenny in yet another blatantly pc affirmative action pandering bit of horrible token casting and the other was a sex slave who bond takes advantage of despite her tragic history and then lets her die with no remorse as if she were a mosquito the chases all seemed like forward movement video games with no sense of where am i and what do i do next decision making the villains overblown plans were ridiculously unnecessary and implausible the best was that this brilliant genius of a villain planned and plotted for years and was foiled by a fire extinguisher bond dies at the beginning which was obviously going to be explained but nooooo he just pops up drinking a heinekin with some hooker in a seedy hotel room with no explanation m and an old geezer use flashlights outdoors while sneaking away from baddies really dumb move by all involved in making that scene way too much psycho babble drama nobody gives a rats backside about non fleming newly fabricated reasons for why this modern day bond impersonator acts the way he does its because the producers are fools and craigs proving himself to be a one note stone faced actor there were no stand out actionescape set pieces that will remain etched in your brain years from now other than maybe those lame cgi komodos or a home alone defend the castle style bit of twaddle i mean right after the heroes stop a phase one attack theyre ammos been spent and a phase 2 helicopter armed with missiles destroys everything they just worked so hard to defend it was a joke of a defense plan and thats the climactic highlight to an action film that contains an awful lot of nonaction oh and the backlash q casting was abominable a young mop hair hipster q with cosmetic only glasses and a complete dislike of gadgets wtf way to whiz on one of the most beloved characters of the franchise ms broccoli overall a soso bond not a best bond there are waaaay too many other great contenders to choose from that blow this one out of the ice filled waters and not a worst bond that honor goes easily to quantum still with the ending resembling classic bond moneypenny ms office and a gruff male m theres still possible maybe hope for better more classis style bond films to come in the future the producers really need to learn to embrace what made bond what it is instead of fighting against that formula to square peg it into todays action junk genre that focuses more on feelings and pouting looks instead of quick thinking reactive action and cleverness witty and well executed actionescape set pieces and stunts that make you squirm in anticipation and excitement at how on earth can he escape that was what made bond appealing in the first place that and the fact that they were spy movies that felt like authentic pulp spy movies bond was and should be a classy suave womanizing gentleman again instead of a hulking sulking whoa is me mommy sensitive jock the craig era started off great with casino royale in huge part thanks to flemings story but hes skyfallen so quickly that i cant wait for a new actor to play bond ive never said that about any of the other actors and wanted all of them to continue making more bonds',\n",

delight and his facial expressions never stop making us choke up and laugh till our stomachs begin to hurtpreviously i saw on the message boards regarding teddy i thought that teddy has made his appearance in another form this time he is a human being he is a child he is stepan max baldry im not sure if you can remember the times when teddy would always be shaken by the waist crazily by mr bean while bonding together before bedtime or teddy gets his neck slammed by the closing of a drawer or teddy getting his head cut off by a pair of scissors unless im just hallucinating or forgetting the actual details but anywaysthis time round teddy gets his own style of revenge teddy is now stepan whose father got stalled away and missed the train this is just like teddy being mistreated before bedtime or right when mr bean wakes up mr bean gets the hello in a different way how does it feel to be slapped mr bean later is also accused of kidnapping and possible abuse for certain kidnappers may inflict on their victims like mr bean did to teddy the mistreatment of teddy tells us that mr bean has taken teddy from another owner and playing with it for himselfbesides the talk on possible missing appearance of teddy i thought that mr bean in this movie decided to take his form of illalwayshavemyway to the next level for example long time ago in mr beans series mr bean would always crash away another persons car to get himself a parking spot this time he did it without his car the funny thing is two weeks ago i went to paris i lived at a hotel near the jardin du luxembourg in order to get to the nearest cinemas i had to make lots of left straight and right turns to reach my destination on foot and of course to get back to the hotel i would reverse the above directions traveling around paris on foot is very easy mr bean took pretty much the same approach however in his very own unique way he made sure that his journey on foot is as straight as a ruler toward his train station it was pretty unnecessary to stay exactly on the magnetic direction to the final destination yes he totally ignored traffic and walked thru avenue des champselysées and various restaurants with itchy hands to get his way and mysteriously also how lucky everything stopped to create a walk path for him toobesides portraying mr bean all the time as the ultimate funny character in all his movies here introduced another form of humor that has been defined by early directors either early directors really do that for their own benefit or that it is just a myth carson clays willem dafoe playback time began really funny the escalator scene lasted probably over 1015 minutes the mistranslated summary speech before the movie began made everything and everyone totally interesting and interested in the end they were wrong they were all yawning and falling asleep sabine was mad at the directors cutting of her scene in his movie mr bean decided with his itchy hands to interfere and switch the movie with his own video perfectly along with the narration regarding the perfect timing one part of his movie before this was even better the performance he pulled while trying to earn money as a beggar not to expose too much he was really good at lipsyncing the entire piecerewinding further the starting scene also shown as in the movie trailer the ability of speaking all kinds of languages at its most basic level can be amusing mr bean plays a part in the language barrier process where he is really good with the two easiest words in french but end up thanking in spanish because the pronunciation of thank you in spanish is easier to master than in french at least for voice projectingas for the other characters like sabine emma de caunes and again the possible teddyinhumanform stepan max baldry emma is very good looking and played an extremely crucial role for mr bean it expresses the growth in time as kids we played with toys when we were young in or out of bed over time we have grown and we begin to build interrelationships with others mr bean gets all excited when he met sabine again who happens to be driving a car very much like his mr bean was so fascinated it was as if he just woke up from a coma and saw his car once again stepan max i believe is teddy in my mind because he is adorable maxs style of frustration and handling things is seemingly close to how he has learned them all thru living with mr bean all those years stepan swears to relieve oneself the duo mr bean and stepan is very much like the good old mr bean and teddy sabine an interesting character who also happens to be a girl has been portrayed as a young boy who finally has grown up and is now building an intimate relationship in real lifeif this is truly mr beans last appearance i will be disappointed because rowan atkinsons mr bean can never be duplicated it is a soulbond adaptation in this era mr beans humor is the living version of funny cartoons it is very suitable for all ages mr bean is still ever so fit and good looking even after ten years i really hope that he will not leave us like this after a short stop',\n",

thomas tulls legendary pictures set twentytwo years after the events of jurassic park jurassic world takes place on the same fictional island of isla nublar off the pacific coast of central america where a fully functioning dinosaur theme park has operated for ten years the park plunges into chaos when a genetically modified dinosaur indominus rex breaks loose and runs rampant across the island jurassic world was released starting from june 10 2015 in over 60 countries the film received positive reviews from film critics who praised it for its visuals action scenes and musical score but drew

standing as the third highestgrossing film of all time without inflation adjustment as well as the highestgrossing film of 2015 a sequel is scheduled for release on june 22 2018themes and analysisdirector colin trevorrow has stated that the indominus rex the synthetic hybrid dinosaur at the center of the films story is symbolic of consumer and corporate excess trevorrow stated that the dinosaur was meant to embody humanitys worst tendencies were surrounded by wonder and yet we want more and we want it bigger faster louder better and in the world of the movie the animal is designed based on a series of corporate focus groups he also stated theres something in the film about our greed and our desire for profit the indominus rex to me is very much that desire that need to be satisfied film journalists have also noted the parallels between the workings of the park in jurassic world and the film and entertainment industry actor james dumont states that the person and the environment are one is one of the obvious themes another theme is that those who do not stop evil are supporting and encouraging it the film also explores the concept of raising an animal in a particular way the indominus rex was raised in captivity without the presence of any siblings thus making the creature somewhat not fully functionalcritical responsejurassic world received praise from

government housing rising from parkour and joyrides to become the top agent for the secret kingsman service and learning a little manners along the way golden circle all but concedes that the gag has run out of steam theres only so many times you can punctuate a dramatic action sequence with a dash of bathos in a casual bruv and it hardly helps that taron egerton still looks as spiffing in a snapback as he does in a bespoke suit and spectacles it is in fact up to the rest of the cast to maintain the stunning profanity per minute ratio until the dialogue becomes witless yes its funny that socalled gentlemen agents let out a curse word every now and then in shrill anger less so when the script is just churning out an endless stream in the face of propriety i was initially giddy at how vaughn props up elton john here as a bizarre addition to poppy adams hall of retro attractions forced to don feathered costumes and perform pained renditions of his greatest hits interspersed with

faces being all loveydovey with their relationship having been cobbled together from a two minute sexual gag from the last film moore may be positively batty and stuck in a cannibalistic 60s diner but the most absurd scene of them all is the danish princess celebrating brandons birthday on a shoddy couch with a bit of vodka suffice to say that no tears are shed when their relationship is put to the test mid film the princess signing off with a premature ejaculation snipe after objecting to what may be the laziest excuse for some sleazy spy hijinks sorry but if you have nanobots that can reverse headshots you also have tracking devices that dont have to be inserted via digital penetration and say goodbye to any earned sentiment from harrys sacrifice because hes back with a bang and say goodbye to any further character depth that may have been hidden behind his mysterious backstory golden circle has written itself into a corner now that firths past has been hollowed out and now that the series narrative backbone in mark strongs merlin has been farewelled the ever reliable guru of the kingsman is always there to deliver exposition without straining too much and add a dash of scottish humour and gentlemanly gravitas where do they even go from here it seems weird to criticise a franchise for having so little foresight in a day and age where sequels and ip regenerations overstuff the box office but in this case it just further highlights how desperate they are for another hit bring firth back anyway you can yelled a studio head make him a ghost or perhaps he had an evil twin yes these are actual ideas tossed up for the film moore is drawn along the same lines as jacksons bieberlicious maccasloving supervillain riffing off the same sort of persona that builds menace through little smiles and uncomfortable moments instead of saving the environment she just wants to rule the world as her drug kingdom and her large scale plot involves blackmailing the president to legalise all her produce and end the war on drugs once and for all but kingsman films dont really do politics they flirt a little with scenarios but lack the gall to really go there the us government stacking up cages of infected victims in a football stadium has just the right amount of zany to make you laugh and then pause but thats about as far as this satire will go in any case the whole thing looks ugly the original at least had a little fun with its action sequences while every moment here is smothered in an almost deafening soundtrack comprised mainly of the thudding brass theme the fights are underlined and stuffed full of speedramped action shots that seemed to have been envisioned first and then built around the camera fetishises all the shiny metal and

is flooding and wherever the water travels the sharks can followthe movie opens when an escaped experimental shark attacks a 25 foot boat the two couples aboard are saved from becoming fish chow at the last moment the resulting publicity gives primary investor russell franklin jackson cold feet about the safety of his money he gives the scientists one final chance and he needs to be present to satisfy his minddr susan mccallister a mildly debeautified saffron burrows is attempting to harvest enzymes found in shark brains for human benefit unfortunately she can produce enough enzyme volume

trait that elevates deep blue sea above nearly every other hunterandhunted movie is its cleverness the closest anybody comes to stupid is when they spend too much time looking at cracking glass harlin and the three writers never contrive situations for extra effect we are warned about the risks each new area holds both the places the humans go and effects of the sharks destruction are entirely reasonable and believable when falling debris burns carters arm he must bandage it to prevent his dripping blood from endangering the whole group sure ladders break with characters on them but those are natural occurrences considering the structural damage around themmost of the tense parts do not even involve a device such as the breaking ladder the humans spend a majority of their time in undamaged areas by moving his camera underwater harlin provides a constant reminder than even those places are not safe in fact two of the decisive encounters occur in undestroyed areasthe layout of the structure is clearly explained when the characters speak amongst themselves we are reminded of the design without hearing them needlessly tell each other what they already know no extra words are needed for us to follow their progress and thinking when mere words are not sufficient harlin shows the speaker skim his finger over a floor plan they discuss the pros and cons of each decision and always make the most intelligent onethe movie makes no attempt to conceal the sources of its plot the chase around a facility with a shrinking safe area comes from the alien movies and the end of jurassic park the idea of smart sharks is taken from jaws harlin borrows the shark vision camera from jaws and composer trevor rabin makes his impending danger theme similar to john williams the sharks die the same way as those from the jaws trilogy deep blue sea does not rip off those films but rather expresses great pride towards its inspirations harlin provides a new twist to their masterful ingenuity without plagiarizing itthe sharks are the main audience draw but the humans remain the movies true stars each has his or her own personality and reaction to traumatic events they are not merely sources for lines that need to be spoken they all have their strengths and drawbacks every personal relationship carries its own dynamic higgins undergoes the most shock and franklin takes responsibility for helping her along some characters undergo change most notably scoggins and dr mccallisterburrows has the most difficult role watching her at the beginning of the movie and then skipping to the end will reveal two different people that indicates successful acting mckenzies part is a close second on the difficulty scale and she also evolves with the character samuel l jackson convinces us of franklins role of stability and authority i agree with james berardinelli jackson is one of the greatest actors working today jane and cool j bring even more to their roles
