dramatic moment in the whole thing in the process he also degraded the entire notion of bohemianism as well as artistic expression political activism and even love itself no small featlarsons bohemia is the east village of the 1990s about ten years after it had already been gentrified beyond recognition and the main problem with his characters apart from the couple of yuppies is that they appear to be completely talentless middleclass kids who arent so much suffering for their art as being too damned lazy to stop pretending that theyre aesthetes and get a job what we do see the performance art of maureen idina menzel the one song that took roger adam pascal over a year to compose is juvenile clichéridden and embarrassing today 4 u the film mark anthony rapp finally unveils at the end of the whole sorry mess is the worst movie ive ever seenthe overriding problem though is that these characters are so pretentious so maudlin and so selfinvolved that not only are they totally unsympathetic but they are also characters that real bohemians would detest i rather suspect theyd detest larsons broadway musical as well the story is about as unconventional as a blueberry muffinbenny taye diggs is one of the only characters who is occasionally believable he is the ostensibly unlikeable nouveau riche landlord who due to the selfaggrandizing excesses of all the other characters comes off as the single compelling human being in the entire thing and thats without the moment of redemption that was apparently excised for brevitys sake which deprives the film of a resolution to its only real conflict and rather defeats the purpose of well dramaexcept for rosario dawson as mimi who is so restrained that neither her ill health or her smack habit extend much beyond her makeup the remaining performances are determinedly stagebound florid mannered and thoroughly unconvincingthe same can pretty much be said for the entire undertaking colombus starts the whole thing inexplicably on a stage with the main characters standing spotlit in a line singing the films single memorable song seasons of love which is really only memorable because they sing it about thirtyseven times during the course of twoandaquarter hours at first i thought this was going to be some kind of framing device that at the end of the film we would find that the central characters had decided to dramatize their story and that we would end up with them back on stage rehearsing the tale to which we had just been subjected but no the opening served no purpose whatsoever except maybe to subtly let us know that the acting was going to be coarse because most of these people had only ever appeared on broadway and were used to playing to the second balcony rather than the cameracolombus abandons the staginess of the opening for what i assume is meant to be some sort of gritty realism theres certainly enough litter and graffiti and flaming rubbish and cracker crumbs strewn about his almost realistic soundstage settings someone should maybe have told him though that the musical is about as unnaturalistic a medium as one can conceive and that mixing the idioms is destined for failurein any event i found myself looking at my watch before all of the main characters had even been introduced which shouldnt be considered a good sign by the time we got to the second finale over two hours later and as the dead mimi miraculously and laughably came back to life due to the divine intervention of a dead drag queen roger was singing thank god this moments not the last i was thinking good god its not fortunately apart from a pointless final montage it was and for the first time in years i left before the first credit had rolled off the screenah well it seems that fans of the stage musical are mostly loving it to death i suspect though that this is akin to what blanket woman aisha de haas says of marks filming of her attack by policemen just trying to use me to kill his guilt its not that kind of movie honey on the contrary rent is exactly that kind of movie its middlebrow audience can watch it weep at the funeral of angel wilson jermaine heredia feel bad

              " 'i have sat through more droning idiotic ridiculous teen comedies in my day than some of you can imagine ive seen films with kids attempting to get their entire school high on marijuana one about a girl modeling herself after coming of age dramas one about three kids throwing a party that gets a little out of hand one showing kids stealing the act answersheet another about a group of skaters pioneering their bold techniques and the list goes on and on redundantly seeing all of those films individually at a point in my life i took away nothing of significance and assumed that the genre was predominately dead and in search of a new voicedear reader stephen chbosky is that voice and his gospel is shown in the perks of being a wallflower an uplifting engaging and entirely complete picture but even that isnt doing it proper justice no matter what i say i cant help but feel im oversimplifying its inherent greatness its terrifically compelling because of its direct approach to the ups and downs of high schools and features exuberant characters who are anything but quirky caricatures we see as humans rather than archetypes chbosky may be an adult but he hasnt lost sight of the true fluctuating nature of american high schools which sometimes seem to be more a competitive battleground than a learning facilityits difficult for me to dub the hurt locker a realistic film fore i have not been in combat and do not have close connection with those who have as an active high school student this film is heavily realistic right down to the reading material the english teacher gives the students the plot concerns charlie newcomer logan lerman an introverted freshman about to slog through 1385 days of high school with no friends and no true life direction hes had his runins with mental illness frequently blaming himself for the death of his aunt who was killed in a car accident on her way to get him a present to illustrate his fears and internal thoughts he pens a letter to an unknown friend so as not to concerns his parentssoon he meets the classclown patrick ezra miller and the artsy sam emma watson two seniors who are stepsiblings that spend their time listening to indie music making mixtapes or attending lowkey parties the three strike a notable bond based on their taste in music and unique view on the world often considering themselves infinitewallflower predominately centers on the relationship between charlie patrick and sam showing them at their most confident and most vulnerable writerdirector chbosky who also penned the novel this film is based on giving him almost entire creative control nobody has any right to say the irrelevant and meaning phrase the book was better than the movie here tackles a wide variety of topics topics that include mental illness homosexuality introverted behavior relationships loose friendships erratic relationships mixed signals depression etc one must not forget that this is a teen film so many of the problems had by characters in other films are repeated here yet that is perfectly with me very very rarely do they play these issues for laughs and choboskys firm grip on the characters and their personalities allowing the audience to connect with them on a very intimate level make this a picture to simply treasure and besides id rather watch a serious film about real but common issues had by teens rather than a comedic film about a niche problem that doesnt take itself as seriously as it wants its audience tothe performances should be unanimously cherished for their authenticity and power that bring this material together logan lerman does terrific work as charlie bringing emotion to his character not in a way that feels manipulated and robotic ezra miller who accentuated pure evil and remorseless malice in we need to talk about kevin is spontaneous comedic relief but so darkly serious and honest at times in his portrayal its physically crippling and as expected emma watson is fantastic as the leading female role especially because she forgoes the anticipated idea of her being the pretty longer with no friends but a big heart she is a brave enigmatic soul who is simply trying to discard the past in search of a brighter more opportunistic future the side characters are great as well including horrormakeup icon tom savini as the shop teacher paul rudd as the english teacher mr anderson who begins to form a relationship with charlie one i wouldve liked to see explored more and joan cusack although do not expect a performance of more than two minutesthis is beautiful filmmaking in every sense of the phrase sure to register with the crowd who recall their high school days and those who are simply sympathetic and empathetic to the current generations wallflowers the hardest emotion to achieve or communicate in cinema in my opinion is empathy its easy to recognize a similar situation youve been in while the character goes about his routine in the same way you did but do you genuinely feel bad for him or truly feel for his problems do you remind yourself he is entirely fictitious therefore no real emotions should be felt i sat in awe as i was presented with raw and unpredictable brutal honest about the labyrinth of high school and regarded my previous years deeply contemplating decisions friendships and the unbreakable bonds i formed were they so infinite am i a wallflower such questions should be considered for much longer after the closing credits end this is the smartest teen movie of the new decade',\n",

successfully executed ménage à trois of down to earth smith asimovs genius and proyas directorial talentadmittedly i did somewhat struggle to see a character such as usually portrayed by will smith wisecracking hero who bathes in his own cynicism and uses charisma for shampoo being incorporated into something vaguely or directly based on a the work of one of the grand masters of science fictionhowever my faith in proyas and his brilliant delivery of dark city sustained my flame of hope that this wasnt going to be yet another regurgitated stereotypical cliché full of corn pile of hollywood dung manureto start with and in part to answer the questioning glances from the ranks of asimov fans the movie i robot is in no way based on any short story or novel ever written by that writer nor does it allude otherwise professor asimov wrote a helluva worth of books almost publishing in all ten categories of the dewey decimal system covering topics as diverse as generalities religion social sciences languages pure sciences applied sciences technology arts literature and history geography its well agreed upon among literary circles that isaac asimov is the only author who has so many well written books in so many different categories of library classification while this movie is not about him i feel its just to present a few key parallels and anecdotes between his vision and that of this filmthe movie is introduced as suggested by isaac asimovs book meaning it incorporates some elements of the robot stories that appeared in asimovs 1950 short story collection titled i robot this collection contains a total of nine short stories revolving around the common theme of future robotics and humanitys quintessential morality interestingly the film started as a screenplay titled hardwired by screenwriter jeff vintar to then have it changed later with the permission of asimovs estate im guessing the title was changed and the story modified to use some characters and plot elements from asimovs stories in order to give it some street cred notably increasing its box office success and not as homage to the writer but i could be wrong or not consequently while the final result clearly contains some of asimovs ideas the story belongs to vintar and fellow screenwriter akiva goldsmanhowever there was an earlier attempt at a movie version of i robot which never made it to the big screen taking place in 1969 same year that neil armstrong unrolled a us flag on the soft surface of the moon or a kubrick directed hoax the rights to story were optioned to hollywood it took another eight years until 1977 when harlan ellison an awardwinning author and good friend of asimov was hired to write a screenplayreportedly ellison worked on this for a year creating a screenplay that both gratified him and one that asimov himself thought would make a great film unfortunately the head honchos at hollywood lacked the nerve to make a movie from that particular screenplay and the project was shelved fortunately for him ellison regained control of his work which was published in 1987 as i robot the illustrated screenplay currently available in paperbackthe movie that was finally made and one that funnily enough is enjoying such box office success does however retain a few interesting and enjoyable parallels delivering several ideas and concepts on the subject of futuristic robotics as envisioned by asimovduring the opening sequence very appropriately and possibly to justify its title the film faithfully starts with the three laws of robotics as per the short story collection1 a robot may not injure a human being or through inaction allow a human being to come to harm2 a robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the first law3 a robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the first or second lawthe positronic brains of asimovs robots were designed around the three laws so that it was impossible for the robots to function without them there were a few ambiguities in the three laws to make for interesting stories but there was only one story in that particular collection little lost robot in which a robot posed any sort of danger to a human beingtrue to the concept the three laws in the movie are hardwired into the positronic brain of each robot as explained by susan calvin the robopsychologist for us robots portrayed by the gorgeous bridget moynahan calvin was the central character of the story collection however while she was brilliant logical and strongwilled asimov never described her as attractive nor feminine nevertheless casting moynahan in this role works well enough as she doesnt come off as your stereotypical gorgeous female scientist but rather someone dedicated to the pursuit of her profession preferring the company of robots and the emotional safety they provide over that of her colleaguesthe movie also centres on robots built by united states robotics the corporation whose full name in asimovs stories is us robots and mechanical men inc in the movie lawrence robertson played by bruce greenwood runs the corporation with the kind of arrogance reserved from the worlds richest tycoons and powerful men epitomised by the likes of bill gates greenwood delivers a convincing laced with contempt and self assuredness performance with his character giving detective del spooner played by will smith reason for resentment toped angstwhile in the short story collection lawrence robertson receives only a brief mention in the introduction as being the first president of the corporation and there are no detectives such as del spooner this doesnt detract from overall plotalso del spooner with his deepseated distrust of robots was reminiscent of elijah baley a character that asimov created for his robot series set of novels starting with the caves of steel and eventually tying in with the famed foundation series also great material for a scifi saga just like spooner baley wasnt overly fond of robots and in that respect is not alone in his feelings with humans in general showing contempt and prejudice towards their mechanical companions in the film all robots are presented in beneficial light having gained wide acceptance in the human societyalfred lanning played by james cromwell is a director of research credited with being the father of robotics is the key to the puzzle opposed to the film rather than hunting down a robot in asimovs novel baley is paired with one as a partner in his murder investigationthe robot character going by the name of sonny and played alan tudyk is undeniably the most interesting in the film reliving us from the try hard selfindulgent wisecracks by will smith and therein lies the problem it took me well over twenty minutes to see past the cliché stereo type casting of smith in the role of the robophobic detective and even till the end he was never quite del spooner to me i found this a little disappointing as im sure i would have enjoyed this more had will smith not acted so damn will smith something that i know he can do from other movies ive seen him in nevertheless for most movie goers this will likely be a minor squabble and lets face it will smith being will sellsproyas commendably directs this block buster debut with a distinct style all of his own and while not as dark or intelligent as dark city still quite effective the camera work is great connecting action and dialogue admirably with the cgi of the robots and the city providing for a realistic sense its easy succumb into belief that what we are seeing could potentially represent the future of humanity despite the obvious current technological limitations and stumbling blocks as our scientist work toward making robots more human in terms of both movement and aiin summary the plot in i robot doesnt represent anything overly complex nor as clever as one would expect based on the source material that was supposedly the inspiration however even being pretty simple it is still a lot better than most other corn infested hollywood flicks out there providing for a good solid 114 minutes of entertainment i did enjoy several crossreferences to different asimov novels and ideas which shows that the guys writing the screenplay were familiar with a good body of his science fiction worki wouldnt go as far as to say this was a brilliant film and i would very much like to have seen the initial screenplay for i robot made into a movie backed by a decent budget however this is unlikely as while potentially being a great or even a brilliant film i couldnt really see it do well at the box office if he were still alive it would have been interesting to know what asimov would have thought of this film i do however have a niggling sensation that being the bon vivant and easy going person that he was he would have enjoyed itstill a bit less will and a tad more sonny and i robot would have been ever better overall a good watchall in all 8510 and a big well done to proyas for not making this suck ',\n",

              " 'both were born in the old continent some days apart in april 1889 both had vaguely similar features incarnated by their memorable toothbrush mustaches more importantly both would become the most famous men of their era charlie chaplin and adolf hitler international stars for the better and for the worse in the twilight of 1939despite their similar backgrounds the two men represent the opposite poles of humanity one dedicated his life for silent comedy as a universal language meant to inspire the purest and most human emotions while the other turned the country of kant into a supremacist nation justifying such atrocities as invasions mass murders and ultimately genocide chaplin was a man of emotions hitler of a rationalism whose meaning was twisted until it became synonym of bestial superiority the law of the strongest or mechanical thinking through the dedication to technology in total contempt for the emotions that resonate for nazis as the language of the weak the great dictator is chaplins answer to this absurdity a message that speaks for humanity universal inspirational and hilariousone scene incarnates the universality of silent comedy the globe ballet illustrating with a poetic finesse the devastating ambitions and the madness inherent not just to hynkel but to all the dictators in the world the balloon popping at the end is the prophetic reminder that justice triumphs sooner or later the whole film contains many classic chaplin moments including the iconic shaving with brahmss hungarian violins reminding how nazism dishonored the beautiful heritage of its civilization other scenes include the confrontation between hynkel and napolini the dictation and the inflamed speech in germansounding gibberish in city lights chaplin used gibberish to humorously denounce sounds futility in the great dictator hynkels gibberish sounds like barks reminding what hitlers voices incarnated to the oppressed people something inhuman hateful violent still better to be mocked than wept overchaplins treatment more than in any of his films tackles a difficult subject with the perfect mix of comedy and drama incarnated by hannah paulette goddard whose illuminating beauty represents the driving force of the film as the eternal dream on a brighter tomorrow as the virginal wound in peoples devastated hearts never losing faith in humanity hannah epitomizes anne francks famous in spite of everything i still believe that people are really good at heart the tender relationship with the jewish barber demonstrates the evilness of an ideology that prevented people from the simplest things simply from being human in the coin in the pudding scene one of the funniest we realize that despite all the noblest feelings the men from the ghetto are just ordinary guys who dont necessarily want to be heroes a subtle but no less clever depiction of jewish humor subtle mix of wit and selfderisionchaplin said that if hed known the extent of the atrocities committed by the nazi he couldnt have made fun of it this is a honest and admirable recognition of the value of comedy its not a weapon but it attacks not rational but it makes you think whatever takes itself too seriously is put in its place and whatever is mocked by the majority gets an extra level of depth and poignancy this is probably why chaplin was uneasy with the gap between hynkel and the original dictator who forever marked the course of history the comedy is still innocent enough to be regarded as an answer to nazisms horrific barbarity which might explain why a few films made fun of hitler after the great dictator and why most of the comedic takes on hitler were from jewish directors as if one had to carry the wound of the tragedy to translate it into laughs as a posthumous attempt to strike back against the evil humor as a defensive almost cathartic process i guessi also guess chaplin believed in that and unconsciously saw himself as one of the oppressed people whether they were jewish or gentle black or white he saw himself as part of humanity and this is where the universality of the little tramp relies on hes the little fellow who speaks for all the little fellows in the world with thrilling words expressing the very principles chaplin stood for kindness love brotherhood happiness universality its not the jewish barber but chaplin himself delivering the most beautiful and intelligently inspirational message transcending the bounds of cinema chaplin who never spoke finally let out all his emotions beliefs and feelings so important that the fact that he was out of the character wasnt relevant the climactic speech rejects the barbarity of nazism fascism any ugly word ending with ism rejects machinery that became synonym of alienation and destruction as foreshadowed in his previous modern times and accepts technology only as an instrument to unite people to strengthen human spirit solidarity empathy not tomania or bacteria chaplin spoke from the bottom of his heart a place named utopia a beautiful dream we tend to reach every day like a true prophet of his era chaplin ahead of his time points the danger of nazism the applauds at the end indirectly highlights the fantastic aspect of the film released in 1940 when the worst was to comebut chaplin made his point and the film works as fantasy with the last metamorphosis of a character proving that justice can triumph over fanaticism and while other filmmakers imagined coldblooded killers machinegunning adolf hitler with an orgasmic satisfaction chaplin appeals to humanity asks people to think as one indivisible brotherhood no nations no frontiers no use of malicious technologies only kindness and humble intelligence to put wings in human souls so they can fly to rainbows of hopenot just chaplins ultimate masterpiece the great dictator is one of the most humanistic cinematic message that never lost its resonance not even after 70 years thank you mr chaplin',\n",

producers and directors are incapable of establishing except the five year mission is old hat so at the end it is revealed they will have a mission in a nebula really isolated from the federation even as the new creative minds go back to what they cant create they have to find a way to alter it what they call improve itthis movie assumes the audience remember the original series and superimposes

massacre then the graphic nature of this opening scene will have a bigger impact upon you the tension and suspense created during these early moments of the film set a nice pace to be carried through spielbergs portrayal of these events creates a very well executed shocking sense of realismi couldnt help but feel however that to some people interest might be lost within the first 10 minutes after showing a portion of reconstructed events in somewhat realistic detail the film shifts to a slower pace with less intrigue with the display of onlookers watching their tv sets and reporters at the scene this can however be construed to be with good reason setting an authentic mood of how people reacted to the news at the time with a very clueless perspective which was achieved well with some archive footage of the events for audience members who remember watching these events on the news this can easily bring back emotions experienced at the timethere is a great feeling of an independent production surrounding this with a hollywood look pasted over the top you can see the money and with spielberg in charge its no surprise this got a major release into the box office this isnt particularly a bad thing though this just goes to show what you can accomplish when a real life drama is granted a healthy budget though it seemed at times that the money was used to acquire the best equipment possible rather than considering the mood of the scenery resultantly this made several sets visually come across as a studio stage where each scene was in actuality shot on location however this does not distract from the rest of the film too much maintaining suspense intrigue and tension throughouteric bana gave an amazing performance practically stealing the show its clear he worked very hard on his accent though geoffrey rush delivered some great acting too his accent didnt feel too solid everybody slipped up a tiny bit here and there but i think rushs accent was the least consistent daniel craig was fairly mediocre in this a bit seminatural he carried his role well but wasnt very consistent there were moments when it felt like he was overacting as if trying too hard to grant his character a sense of realismthe other notably great performance was from mathieu amalric who plays a character called louis avners primary source for gathering names of black september members he is a very intricate well written character there is something naturally sinister about amalric as an actor and this aided him well here making louis a subtly untrustworthy character the chemistry between amalric and bana was brilliant they were very natural together and this made their scenes together very captivatingone particular scene to mention shows louis taking avner to his fathers place for lunch surrounded by a very large family louiss father came across as a somewhat contrived character in the things he said the character was written to portray a certain level of wisdom delivering various metaphors such as butchers hands gentle souls and saying to his son you centaur you minotaur the whole scene was an explosion of forced metaphor and felt a little detached from the rest of the filmstructured around attempts on members of black september munich is well designed and artistically executed each attempt on a member of black september brings an excellent level of conflicting humanity evil and power their first potential assassination brings about the realisation that they are not only killing people with terrorist involvement they are killing fathers sons uncles and brothers these people despite their evil are people who will be missed though avners team believe themselves to have faith in the operation they are carrying out their morality often gets in the way as they try to execute their target and their target alone bringing about a certain degree of failure with each attempt the character development is well orchestrated giving us a group of very compassionate and moral assassins this is displayed best at the meal time scenes the main characters always share large homecooked meals with each other to discuss their execution plans this is some great symbolism showing how they can participate in something so tidy and civilised only to discuss plans of something so messy and monstrous these meal times gradually display a realisation of potential futility in their operation as the film moves along avner starts to question the morality of what he is the leader of if what he is doing is the right thing to do whether it is justified whether he was manipulated by the government of his own country to carry out an operation for selfish national objectives or pure revenge its a very well orchestrated ambivalent mix of compassion and evil and the protagonist knows this due to this we ultimately have a traumatised hero who feels as if he has accomplished nothing making not only the character but the audience realise the futility of retaliation and terrorism as a wholei rate this film a respectable 7 out of 10 its a well worth seeing and is very enjoyable great performances story script and great historical research from what ive read of the actual events of the munich massacre the film appears to be very historically accurate and the mix of fiction is superbly balanced its great to see an alister like steven spielberg tackle such a challenging piece this is one of those films not necessarily designed to entertain but to teach us about humanity and the depth and fragility of human emotion and mentality as well as a bit of

criticism could very well apply to the original moviethats not to suggest the first clash lacked a plot it featured a hero the classic greek hero perseus the mortal son of zeus perseus embarks on a quest to save the princess andromeda and her home city from a sea monster along his way he faces gigantic scorpions a trio of hideous witches a rejected beast of a man named calibos and the cursed creature medusa its an interesting enough plot and one that the new movie emulates to a degree but the pacing of the original movie and the unfolding of the plot were both rather haphazardperseus presence in the city is the doing of the sea goddess thetis jealous of the fact that zeus son is blessed with everything her son calibos is not thetis transports perseus to the city where he learns of calibos efforts to ruin andromedas happiness when perseus intervenes and frees andromeda of the deformed mans influence and when andromedas mother cassiopeia suggests that her daughter is more beautiful than any goddess thetis places a curse on the city which can only be lifted if andromeda is sacrificed to the dreaded krakentheres nothing wrong with a hero rescuing cities slaying monsters and marrying princesses in fact its kind of the entire job description on the other hand harry hamlin who plays perseus in the 1981 version goes from scene to scene with all the intensity of a teenager on a scavenger hunt sam worthington adds something hamlins perseus was lacking motivation worthingtons perseus didnt arrive in andromedas city by chance his adopted family were caught in the crossfire of a rebellion between men and gods and only his own divine heritage kept him from dying with them his quest is fueled by a desire to avenge their deaths on the god hades who stole their lives and in this version called for andromedas sacrificeperseus had good reason to hate the gods or at least be suspicious of them his love of his adopted family and grief over their deaths at the hands of a god led him to reject any connection to the gods even his father zeus played in the 2010 version by liam neeson zeus is sympathetic to the plight of humanity however his anger at the rebellion which culminated in a group of soldiers tumbling his statue into the sea led him to allow his brother hades to remind mankind of the order of things he does try to help his son on his quest though there are overtones of an almost christian relationship between zeus perseus and humanity at large in this remakea few of the more obvious differences between the original and the remake include perseus companions originally most of the soldiers who accompanied him had neither names nor much character development now perseus follows the soldiers rather than leading them they all have names backgrounds and their own personal feelings about a demigod joining them in their efforts to save their homeanother character who is between men and gods is the immortal io played by lovely british actress gemma arterton cursed to stay young while those she loves grow old and die her extended lifetime of acquired wisdom and knowledge makes her an invaluable guide for perseus she fills two roles the wise mentor originally filled by ammon played by film legend burgess meredith and the love interest originally filled by princess andromedathat second revision came as somewhat of a relief to me perseus had hardly any time or reason to become as heavily invested in andromeda as he did in the first movie when you save someones life its expected that a bond will form between you but for hamlins perseus it was apparently love at first sight im romantic enough to let that slide usually but worthingtons on screen romance with arterton was much more believablenow lets tackle the purist objections its my position in the case of sequels at least you should adhere to the source material as closely as possible remakes however are supposed to stray within reason did perseus and io have a relationship in the previous movie no on the other hand perseus didnt ride pegasus the winged horse in the original greek myth as he did in both movies he wore winged shoes given to him by the gods the thrilling line release the kraken delivered by zeus in both movies was never uttered by classical zeus simply because the kraken wasnt a creature from greek myth was hades ever an actual villain as he is so often portrayed in film no he was simply the god of the underworld a position he was never tricked into acceptingits called artistic license if remakes were supposed to be faithful then we wouldnt need them would we wed just watch the original again which i did before watching this one with all due respect to ray harryhausen i prefer the remade clash of the titans director louis leterrier did a fine job diagnosing what worked from the original film and what didnt cutting scenes here and amending them there what he ultimately produced may fit the label of a rock n roll epic

              " 'saving the earth from cataclysmic disaster is a way in which stories can uplift viewers with its characters selflessly putting their lives on the line for the better good but when a film ventures fifty years into the future into a world which is somewhat incomprehensible only to tell the same tale its amazing that it can also possess a good level of maturity creating characters that are believable in their actionsas humankinds last hope of survival a crew of eight are launched into space on a mission to reignite the sun which is undergoing a process of dying with a massive explosive charge on board the icarus ii the crew are in fact the earths second chance at surviving the freezing cold after a previous crew had failed however a simple plan turns bad when a distress signal is found from the missing icarus i and it is decided to meet up with the spacecraft a miscalculation ensues and the icarus ii is forced to sustain critical damage to its oxygen supply resulting in fatal decisions being made from each individual crew membersunshine sports a story which is very much character driven and this is partially due to the limited selection of environments which itself helps users become identifiable with the unique technology possible in the future with this accomplished the story is able to allow for solid pacing with gripping suspense being interchanged with cinematic subtlety into horror the questions of human survival are tastefully executed allowing for a film that can easily work on various levels if one chooses if anything the story suffers when we are finally given a glimpse of earth and its dire condition while the scenery is realistic in context all mystery surrounding the earth that the crews of icarus i and ii were trying to save is lostthe entire cast while not award winning in their acting prove utterly convincing capa cillian murphy and mace chris evans are easily the most dominate who while constantly at each others throats share similar traits in regards to the best possible action in achieving their mission the other actors help create a distinct cause of contrast in respect to their characters personalities with a prime example being between kaneda hiroyuki sanada who will give up his life in order to repair the shields of the ship and secondincommand harvey troy garity who fears his own death and is willing to compromise the mission to save his life an important aspect of the characters portrayed is the element of paranoia which brings about important issues of human survival and as well helping the contrast of the various crew aiding the present paranoia is a great selection of music which is constantly eerie and at times yields stints of grandeur a problem with the use of sound comes in the form of the the female onboard voice of icarus 2 there is a hint of seductiveness in the voice which comes across as out of placethis is not the only problem however while the film is based upon the sun the director danny boyle perhaps places too much emphasis on the sun with some awesome special effects which are reminiscent of those found in the fountain the problem is not that there is too much of it for it realistically helps exude an important aspect of the film but it at times seems to place less focus on the characters themselves sadly the special effects of the suns rays bring about another difficulty there are a minute selection of scenes which make use of a strange screen distortion which is highly unrealistic but seems to be put in place due to the high number of special effects used for the sun which in themselves makes scenes less viewable to the viewer these screen transitions are used for the purpose of mystery but come across as an amateur attempt at bestthe film does an excellent job of not resorting to sex or nudity or milder representations thereof to help titillate viewers instead a more mature and realistic approach is taken and this brings about a variety of contextual language which is more placed in groups rather than sporadically throughout sunshine is also not without violence which is haunting instead of commercialised the many deaths while not especially gut wrenching do prove to fit their respective situations with one scene showing the aftermath of a successful suicide attemptsunshine illuminates itself into the best that cinema has to offer every aspect is well conceived in its execution but it is not without its faults these however never distract from what is ultimately an entertaining and thought provoking experience also available on entertainmentwikia ',\n",

her but thats not all a monster is there too it is hunting thats a bit of a synopsis of the story told in a very vague and short way but i want to keep it interesting so hey the directing of stranger things was mostly done by the duffer brothers as they are credited aka matt duffer and ross duffer these two directed six episodes they were really great at first i didnt think that they could pull it of directing with the two of them but after seeing the pilot i knew that they could they made every shot look like a piece of art but of course this isnt only thanks to them also thanks to the brilliant cinematographers they were great at their job there was only one shot that i think couldve looked better and that was the one in the last episode where hopper looks up with a bit of teary eyes this shot just looked a bit of to me ive praisen the duffer brothers but they werent my favorite directors of the show this was shawn levy he only directed two episodes but he did them well it was barely noticeable that there was a different director but some of levys camera movements were just fantastic with this i dont mean that the duffer brothers didnt have some good camera movements in the last three episodes they were also fantastic the editing was handled masterfully but with some flaws sometimes i could see a splitsecond of another shot whereafter the shot really changed this i could see around two times in total this doesnt take away the fact that the editing was great there were some clever cuts in the second last and the last episode switching between the perspective of hopper and wills mom and the kids this was also very good this kept you on the edge of your seat and both sides had different pacings which was very interesting they were both tense full but on another way with the kids it was faster paced than with hopper and joycein contrast to the cgi this was fine but noticeable well it was way better than some of the cgi i see in movies nowadays i think that they couldve made it more scary if they used props instead i can understand why they didnt do that though for practical reasons but lets not forget that this is still a tvshow even though it looks like a movie most of the time and thats a compliment and that its common that tvshows dont have great cgi they did also use some great sets the sets of the upside down world were good looking and had a scary feel to them the soundtrack was superb i very much liked the songs as you can see in the title of my review i used a part that is song a lot in the movie the songs fitted the theme quiet well after this i usually discuss the actors so lets stay in the trend shall we the series has a big cast so i will select some people out of it first of we have winowa ryder as joyce or wills mom she was very good she had some bad moments but these flew away quickly she showed of her emotional side throughout most of the show and at the end a more relaxed side it was very cool to watch her switch between both mike was the leader of the group if i had to pick one he was played by finn wolfhard as a kid actor he was fantastic so were the other kid actors millie bobby brown gaten matarazzo caleb mclaughlin i want to mention millie in particular because she was the standout to me she was really good she played the character of eleven i also find it impressive that she shaved of her hair thats very brave for such a young girl natalia dyer played nancy she too was great charlie heaton wasnt as good as everyone else but was still goodthe script is also very good not just the dialogue but the story and characters as well each character has depth or makes an arc and you care about each single one of them which makes the series only more tense weird hu hollywood that when you care about characters the action scenes are more tense and better maybe you should try that for once the character of steve surprised me the most he seemed like a douche but thanks to fantastic writing i started to like him more and he also changed and became nicer but the thing that i really want to mention is how quickly the show makes you care about someone only in the second episode the second i already was near to crying when jonathan hung up posters of his brother that he had made his acting was fantastic at that moment and you could see the grief in his eyes which is also something good

              " 'michael mann has done it again this man is a genius when it comes to the epic crime saga it started back in 1995 when he released the masterpiece heat which blew the world away with its amazing acting and fantastic memorable shootouts then in 2004 he stuck with crime in la and came out with collateral which again featured great acting and some memorable action sequences he was back at it again in 2006 with the film version of the 80s tv show miami vice which admittedly wasnt as good as the previous two but still had some engaging action scenes 2009 came along and mann decided that for his next project he would tackle the story of infamous bank robber john dillinger and once again doesnt disappoint the story opens in 1933 with john dillinger played by johnny depp and his crew breaking out of prison in indiana so right off the bat michael mann is showing off his skills as a director by staging this prison break and including a mini shootout between the gang and the prison guards this film is a true team effort though not only is the director at the top of his game but the actors are all uniformly excellent johnny depp completely absorbs the role of dillinger and literally becomes him depp has always been one of the greatest character actors and once again can do no wrong christian bale plays the role of fbi agent melvin purvis and is also quite good bale has become the goto man for movies over the past few years batman terminator 310 to yuma and many more on his resume leading or supporting it doesnt matter bale can handle any role and in this film he becomes depps equal as the two go back and forth throughout dillinger toys with purvis by narrowly escaping him a few times before being caught which sets up a fictitious showdown between the two at a prison though the scene isnt nearly as good it does have a lot of similarity to the now infamous coffee shop scene from heat just to see dillinger and purvis go back and forth even for just two minutes was really something to behold the supporting actors in this film play small yet important roles stephen dorff giovanni ribisi marion cotillard stephen lang billy crudup dorff and ribisi play members of dillingers gang crudup is very good as fbi head honcho j edgar hoover cotillard is pretty good also as dillingers love billie frechette actors of such caliber as johnny depp and marion cotillard really bring out the emotion in their characters and make us as the audience feel for them and even though this is a true story and we know how it ends we still kinda wish they end up together stephen langs character ends up being the one that fires the fatal shot that finishes off dillinger as he was walking out of a movie at the biograph theater in chicago in the end it all comes back to michael mann who almost perfectly crafts the story of john dillinger in a way that blended fact and fiction quite seamlessly while it did have a few historical inaccuracies that doesnt take anything away from the achievement of mann and the actors they all do the story justice and really transport us into the world of the chicago area during the depression era of the 1930s public enemies doesnt quite reach the heights of manns masterpieces heat and the insider but that doesnt stop him from staging huge shootouts that try to rival the ones seen in heat and this does continue to show that michael mann is a cinematic genius when it comes to the epic crime saga and i cant wait to see which crime world he decides to tackle next',\n",

              " 'there are movies like hot fuzz and the other guys that are the typical buddy cop movies that are still hilarious i never thought i would say this but you can add the heat to that list sandra bullock and melissa mccarthy have great chemistry in the female side of a buddy cop comedy cliché yes but funny the story lacked but i still found myself laughing a lot more than i thought i ever would have i had no intentions of seeing the movie but i sure am glad i did it wasnt amazing and memorable but it was a good way to spend my night the heat follows the guidelines to a cop comedy down to every detail bullock and mccarthy are exact opposites the comedy mainly comes from one of them they hate each other learn to love each other something tragic happens then the grand finale if you think you have seen a movie like this before you probably have but that doesnt mean it isnt a good movie bullock plays the overachieving by the book cop who is looking for the promotion she always wanted she is very talented and is a good fbi agent but she is obnoxious her character is written very well but she was too extreme mccarthy was also written to the extreme this was obviously done on purpose but all the comedy stemmed from mccarthy for the first two thirds of the movie in the last act bullock let her colors shine and the two of them were funny together i wanted more of that throughout the entire movie melissa mccarthy is a very funny and very talented actress who hopefully has a bright future a role like this was good for her to get her name out there and she shined bright her raunchy attitude and appearance was hysterical and the fact that she was from boston made it even funnier the scenes with her family though exaggerated were easily the funniest bill burr played a small role as her brother but his one scene was a riot michael rapaport is also in the movie and he is on screen just enough i like him as an actor but he works better as a minor role as he is in the heat mccarthy struggles to get along with her family and that was her only weakness in her rock hard personality and gritty character her introductory scene was one of the funniest i have seen for a character in a while she is sitting in her patrol car and one of her first lines is telling a cop over the radio to f off it showed her character and foreshadowed who she would be for the entire movie her dialogue was really funny as she embarrasses buster from arrested development s he tries to get a prostitute in his car a few more outrageous events occur and as funny as it was i had to play the reality card as funny as me and my friends thought it was the stuff she does throughout this movie is unacceptable for a boston detective and in real life would not be tolerated i loved seeing her play russian roulette with a suspect but that would not end well in real life as funny and great as mccarthy was she overshadowed everybody else in the movie bullock is annoying i wanted to jump into the screen and shake some sense into her it was her exaggeration which made her great but her performance wont be what people will be talking about when people talk about this movie they will say how great mccarthy was and forget all about sandra bullock dont worry i didnt forget her acting was phenomenal and she developed as a character and was very funny her comedy was different from mccarthys and the scene where she is drunk is one that should be a montage on youtube she is getting up there in age a little bit but she is still really hot in this movie shes still got it and she is as sexy as ever many things worked in this movie but the story was not one of them again this movie focused so much of mccarthy being funny it didnt really care about anything else if somebody asked me what the story of the heat was i would have to stop and think about it basically these two cops get matched together to stop a crime in boston i cant really say what the crime is i know it has to do with drugs and who supplies the drugs rapaport is involved somehow and there is a big twist at the end which really has no impact to the story i didnt see the twist coming but then again it came and went and i really didnt care the ending was really funny and a sequence with mccarthy bullock and a knife literally had me in tears laughing but the story behind it was weak the story was forgettable making the movie forgettable this is unfortunately a summer movie that will come and go and be forgotten this movie will come out on blu ray i will see it in the shelves laugh at how funny it was and pass by to but whatever i went in the store for overall the heat is a good time i dont regret seeing it but i will forget all about it in a matter of time this movie was really a springboard for melissa mccarthy i hope and she got all the attention she was the cornerstone of the movie and that was a mistake she was very funny and she did the best job she could have done but it took away from the movie as a whole for that it gets the willyt recommendation',\n",

story interestingly australian director john hillcoat of the proposition and scenarist nick cave have boiled down the essence of matt bondurants 2008 historical novel the wettest county in the world for a colorful sometimes savage saga about the american free enterprise system what truth lies in the novel is debatable since bondurant wrote about his own grandfather jack bondurant along with his two grand uncles and their high octane depression era exploits as moonshiners who refused to capitulate to outside strong arm interests most of lawless chronicles the efforts of corrupt lawmen as they shake down rural bootleggers anybody who doesnt grovel pays a terrible price these sadistic dastards with badges tar and feather one unfortunate bootlegger and leave him for dead on his kins front porch despite the eruptions of sudden noisy violence that will startle some and shock others lawless has more than its share of quiet introspective moments to offset its bits of sergio leone style violence indeed hillcoat and cave squeeze in to two love stories cinematically this atmospheric yarn looks like the coen brothers depressionera opus o brother where art thou but it takes itself far

forrest calls the shots howard serves as the muscle jack sweeps the floors surprisingly the bondurants even sell shine to the local constabulary this is one of many surprises that occur throughout lawless and make it a lively offbeat genre exerciselawless presents its largerthanlife events from the perspective of jack the runt of the litter jack struggles to measure up to his two imposing brothers they are always ridiculing his best efforts jacks closest friend is a nerdy county boy cricket pate dane dehaan of chronicle who was crippled during his infancy by rickets cricket conjures up clever means to manufacture moonshine when jack visits cricket he finds cricket brewing whiskey in a huge still beneath his backwoods mansion in the basement cricket pipes the brew up through a spigot at the sink and dispenses it in a mason jar at one point young jack observes that the fires illuminating hundreds of illegal stills in the woods of franklin county appear like a constellation of

that should forrest anticipate rougher treatment two thugs arrive at forrests bar and inflict maximum pain on him later after other depredations rakes kills somebody close to the bondurantsdirector john hillcoat keeps things moving swiftly enough so the story never bogs down after the gunsmoke settles and the bodies are hauled off hillcoat wraps up the history neatly and gives us a glimpse of what the actual participants looked like in a 1917 black and white photograph hillcoat stages several aboveaverage shootouts especially the bulletblasting finale at a covered bridge film editor dylan tichenor and hillcoat have done a splendid job of editing the action scenes so the violence is more dramatic than gratuitous in other words the violence may make you flinch but you wont be sickened by unnecessary gore the attention to period detail seems scrupulous too hillcoat substitutes georgia for virginia the rustic settings the wooden barns and the country stores as well as the cleanscrubbed urban cityscapes with period advertisements give lawless an authentic feel cinematographer benoît delhomme of 1408 captures those hundreds of fires blazing against the majestic backdrop of rural virginia with his panoramic widescreen lens memorable movies about moonshiners in the south are few and far between lawless ranks as the best example about rural bootleggers since the moonshine war

runner a brilliant man with many extraordinary talentsthe imitation game follows turing from his early years attending boarding school his work during wwii to the investigation interrogation and ultimately his sentencing during the early 1950sbenedict cumberbatch beautifully plays alan turing bringing him to life and showcasing what an incredible mind this strange but undeniably lovable man had cumberbatch has built up an impressive resume throughout his career just in the last few years hes been in oscar nominated films august osage county 12 years a slave the hobbit trilogy star trek into darkness and has given superb performance in television series parades end and bbcs sherlock however cumberbatch gives his best performance to date he brings something to turing that dissociates him from any other character hes played raising the bar higher once again its the little things that cumberbatch executes which make this performance resonate his elongated breathes his fixating distant eyes his lighthearted giggles and even just twitching his facial muscles heightens his imitation of turningcumberbatch wasnt the only one that played his part remarkably keira knightleys sweet eager and increasingly independent joan clarke delivers an outstanding counterpart and companion for turing knightley has a subtlety to her acting that doesnt leave her outshone by her fellow actors it only pushes her further into the limelight making her performance believable and relatable on many different levelshowever matthew goode allen leech matthew beard and rory kinnear all give amazing performances that should not be forgotten or taken lightly and with the recent ensemble performance award win at palm springs international film festival it may be harder to do so especially if the awards keep cominganother aspect that stands out is the writing first time feature film writer graham moore has developed a lyrical and yet mechanical story that ebbs and flows through four decades its beautifully haunting from start to finish and takes the audience on an emotional journey the writing never felt rushed and everything shown felt connected and conclusive it almost felt like a ticking clock counting down the decades years and moments of importance in turings life the timeline and its portrayal is a favourite element of minemoretn tyldums directing approach was perfect for this story it comments on everything in a subtle way while pulling you into the complex emotion of the piece that both engrosses and disgusts you it explores the horrors of war the dilemmas and the ultimate sacrifices in a visually cinematic crowd pleaser tyldum allowed his actors the freedom of expression by using medium to close up shots in dialogue driven scenes he singles out the emotion and strain in characters during pivotal scenes without taking focus away from whats being saidoscar fauras cinematography allows light darkness pain and hope to incandesce through the audience every single shot is dealt with such care and attention to detail he creates an atheistically compelling semblance for the audiencethe editing of this film is another excellent example of the imitation games charm william goldenberg won an oscar for his work in argo he demonstrates time after time the importance of storytelling he allows emotion to seep through in suspense building scenes and can find it no matter how small or big the scene appears he slows and quickens the pace when needed to build tension suspense drama and joy goldenberg knows how to make an audience scream with joy ache with pain and cry in anguish oscar nominated alexandre desplat composed an eerily beautiful score thats full of rich and raw emotion what sets apart desplats score is the instrumentation of three pianos drama scores are usually orchestrated to rely heavily on the string section with piano in the background even though desplat uses strings to push our emotions and forge movement the clear star is his melodic piano phrasesby using three pianos that intertwine he creates melodic and rhythmic complexity that mirrors chaos and turings quick fast paced brilliant mind he composes a sense of mechanics turning and clicking away heavily alluding to how turing himself is a machine some of my favourite tracks are the imitation game uboats alone with numbers the machine christopher decrypting a different equation and alan turings legacy what is also remarkable about the imitation game is how it underlines the view of homosexuality and femininity in todays society it comments on many relevant assumptions opinions and beliefs that surround being gay or trying to prove yourself but what it distinguishes best is the prejudices against anyone who is differentcumberbatch has stated in interviews that he hopes this film acts as a celebration of turings life since i was unaware of whom this man was i believe it will not only act as a celebration but also an education for many

disappointing that iron man 2 the sequel to one of my alltime favourite comicbook movies doesnt join the clubthe movie kicks off where the last film ended with playboy inventor and millionaire tony stark robert downey jr revealing his secret identity of iron man to the world little does he know that a russian genius named ivan vanko mickey rourke plans to take revenge on tony for an old family grudge six months later whilst tony is soaking up the public love for iron man vanko strikes hard this couldnt come at a worse time for tony unbeknownst to anyone but himself and vanko the palladium in tonys chest reactor the thing which is meant to be keeping him alive is slowly killing him whilst he races to find a cure he promotes his assistant and love interest pepper potts gwyneth paltrow to ceo of his company stark industries slimy senator stern garry shandling and oddball rival arms dealer justin hammer sam rockwell are snapping at tonys heels trying to get him to hand over the iron man tech with tonys military pal colonel james rhodes don cheadle replacing terrence howard caught in the middle and whats up with tonys new mysterious assistant natalie scarlett johansson for the first and third acts this film rocks hard one minor quibble why say that the soundtrack is made up of acdc songs then put just two of their songs in the movie apart from that these 75 minutes are the most sensational fun that i have had at the cinema so far this year the performances are great the dialogue crackles the visual effects are fantastic and the action is electrifying for those glorious 75 minutes i would rank iron man 2 as one of my favourite comicbook moviesunfortunately director jon favreau and screenwriter justin theroux trip up badly in the second act theres some action vankos jail break and a punchup between a drunken tony and rhodes in another suit but this part is mainly talking based on the snappy dialogue of the first act this shouldnt be a problem but apart from the occasional burst of inspired writing and some brilliant injokes i loved the captain america reference this part of the movie is surprisingly dull drifting off more than it should and lacking the rocknroll energy of the other 75 minutes tonys burgeoning alcoholism apparently the most emotionally potent storyline in the comics is tossed aside in an embarrassing party sequence whilst his heart poisoning is dealt with too quickly and confusingly plus rourkes brilliant villain gets relegated to scenes in a laboratory the acting humour action and occasional bursts of wit save this act but the energy and pizazz of the first and third acts is gone making these 45 minutes the spanner in the works which stops iron man 2 from matching or topping its predecessorthe acting is consistently brilliant don cheadle is an improvement over terrence howard cheadles more convincing as a colonel and in his relationship with downey jr than howard whilst bringing grit and humour to the part as pepper gwyneth paltrow is both warm and witty the bickering between pepper and tony is a highlight showing the lovehate relationship between two people dancing around their true feelings for each other as with the first iron man you could argue that paltrow imbues the proceedings with welcome heart as justin hammer rockwell is hilarious yet he is also edgily intriguing hammer is a ratty strange copy of tony before he experienced his epiphany of the first film he reminded me of venom from spiderman 3 except better utilised and more suited to the performer rockwell nails the role with his quirky brilliance as vanko rourke creates a character with commendable humanity whilst rourke could have easily been comic thanks to his exaggerated russian accent he instead comes across as an imposing and intelligent character simmering with barely compressed rage scarlett johansson does what she needs to do in the role of natalie aka black widow she remains enigmatic enough for a spinoff to be welcome and provides a sexy attraction for the men in the audience one thing that johansson excels at is her stunt work in the final 30 minutes she faces off against a hallway of goons and the results are breathtaking garry shandling is noteperfect as senator stern he gets the films last and best line whilst samuel l jackson brings his usual cool and charisma to the role of nick fury the director of the mysterious shield organisationbut the film belongs to downey jr as stark downey jr is magnificent he is funny smart and spoton with the oneliners he combines superhuman energy with a humanity which makes even starks most selfish actions forgivable downey jr is one of my favourite actors and he doesnt disappoint with this superlative performanceiron man 2 is absolutely topnotch blockbuster entertainment for its first and third acts thrilling hysterically funny written with envious wit and brilliantly acted and directed id say that these portions even surpass the first film however one thing that iron man had was consistency in its brilliance something which its sequel lacks the middle act of this film drags it down into the middle tier of comicbook movies maybe im being too harsh maybe when i see it again ill change my mind and show it more love for now iron man 2 is a halfstunning halflacklustre film which overall makes a blast of fun at the cinema and a solid if not great kickoff to the summer season of movies be sure to stay after the credits for one mouthwatering teaser which has me excited for one particular upcoming marvel project',\n",

              " 'die hard 2 is one of those sequels that is unfortunately just a little too in love with what came before to really stand on its own you know what im talking about movies like ghostbusters 2 or rush hour 2 that simply coast by on repeating what worked in the original while doing little else to differentiate itself other than changing the setting or upping the stakes a bit yes after the neo classic that was the original die hard it seems like the production team and director renny harlin were perhaps a bit frightened of the prospect of a followup so they played it safe and i can definitely understand that reasoning and i dont necessarily even blame them for it but still it has to be said the best moments of die hard 2 are those few fleeting glimpses of originality that are occasionally injected into key sequences the rest of it just a slightly inferior retread of what came before is it bad no not by any stretch but it is a bit of a step backwardsa few years after saving the day at nakatomi paza new york cop john mcclane bruce willis is on his way to pick up his wife holly bonnie bedelia at washington dulles international airport on christmas eve however theres a game afoot as a group of evil former special forces operatives headed by the vile colonel stuart william sadler seize control of the airport in an attempt to free general ramon esperanza franco nero a drug lord and dictator from the nation of val verde who is being transported to the us to be tried for his crimes with the planes in the air held hostage mcclane must now battle his way through the airport in order to stop this deadly scheme and save the day and his wife once againto give credit where it is due the cast is uniformly excellent willis is as charming and charismatic as ever and its fun seeing him back in the role that helped define his superstardom especially now with the added bonus of him being somewhat selfaware of just how ridiculous it is to be in this situation once again which generates some good humor and informs the character bedalia is a ton of fun in her returning role as holly and its a shame that she didnt continue to play the part in future installments she helped ground john and make him feel like a real person william sadler is adequately menacing as our lead villain and though hes no hans gruber youll definitely love to hate colonel stuart theres also some really nice supporting roles including a blinkandyoullmissit pret2 robert patrick as one of stuarts thugs and a really fun cameo from reginald veljohnson as his iconic character al powellfinnish director renny harlin takes the seat helm this entry in the series and i think he does a really great job visually and aesthetically especially given this was his first massive film hes got a good sense of composition and flow that works well for the material and he knows how to paint thrilling and stylish sequences of bloody action and harrowing stakes with ease even with his background mainly in the world of horror he proves himself quite capable its almost a shame in retrospect especially seeing where his career has gone in recent years with a string of critical and commercial failures the man knows how to make a fun flick and i hope he recovers and is able to deliver on his promise once againwritten by original cowriter steven e de souza and series newcomer doug richardson the script is the source of both the films most rampant strengths and also its most tragic failures penning a sequel is always a hard thing to do especially with high stakes and even higher expectations and i do think that de souza and richardson for the most part capture the spirit of the original and at its best there are some really great sequences i particularly admired some later scenes where mcclane is actually about to leave the airport as it not only broadened the story but also showed us something new and exciting and its these moments of originality where the film most shines however as i mentioned above the problem is that there seems to be an inherent fear to try too much new with the film and thus it often boils down to just simply reusing tired and true ideas from the first film lots of mcclane crawling through vents while complaining lots of shoot outs in small spaces lots of people talking over the radio and even some secondary characters like william athertons smarmy reporter richard thornburg are brought back in wholly superfluous supporting roles for no other reason than the film to highlight them in an attempt to win the audience over with nostalgia it feels too safe for a die hard movie and the inability to take any real risks brings it down a lotthankfully its not a deal breaker the excellent performances likable characters and sharp visual direction are able to overcome many of the fundamental issues in the storytelling in the end die hard 2 never reaches the great heights of the original and outside of a certain fifth film that i like to pretend doesnt exist because its unwatchable its probably the weakest of the series but its still most certainly a die hard film at its core and its still a ton of fun it just cant quite elevate itself beyond the level of pretty good due to it just repeating what came before but with somewhat less flairi give die hard 2 a decent 7 out of 10 fans of the original should check it out but dont go in expecting another classic',\n",

              " 'district 9 is perhaps the best science fiction film since the matrix startling words for a little film out of south africa with a mostly untested cast and crew but it is doubtful that the phrase will be contested by manygoing in knowing very little is key to the success of this enigmatic masterpiece of contemporary cinema blending techniques from the schools of cinéma vérité and avantgarde district 9 details an alternate history of the world where a spaceship lands in south africa in the 1980s its occupants some 1millionplus aliens are given refugee status and forced to live in a shanty town fenced off from most of the human populationusing government official wilkus van de merwe first time actor sharlto copley as the central character of the film district 9 jumps between being a faux documentary loaded with expert interviews handheld camera footage and security camera footage to a gritty dystopic allegory mixing in elements of apartheid big business and even nazi germany but through seamless editing the major jumps are barely noticeable while some films find it hard to move from style to style without feeling jarring or blatantly forced district 9 manages to find a masterful way of movement that feels all too natural much like danny boyles oscarwinning slumdog millionaireit is because of this wildly original motif that district 9 stands out as such an amazing piece of filmmaking low budget miracles aside the film plays out unlike anything you have ever seen it is truly a unique and original film using the relatively untapped documentary style narrative for the majority of the film the method of storytelling here is so powerful that one wonders why no one else has ever thought to make a film like this before doing away with complexities it is so simple it almost pains me to think that some people just will not get it in a decade littered with films that ape off of significantly better films or just feel stale altogether here is a small film that is so wildly off the grid that it practically demands to be seen to be believedi mention some not being able to grasp the story and ideologies director neil blomkamp is putting forth because the film is undeniably and unapologetically antihollywood there is no flare of contemporary glamour no big name actors or crew members outside of producer peter jackson no transformersstyle big budget effects nothing that screams contemporary american studioproduced cinema but at the same time it does not feel like a low budget indie or a foreign produced festival film it feels like it is oneofakind a starting point for a breed of experimental filmmaking films like children of men cloverfield and united 93 have used the stylistic and experimental means of cinéma vérité to their advantages over the past few years and stand out as uniquely made films but district 9 is the first film in a very long time that really harnesses the medium as an experiment and succeeds at being so unlike anything that has been released for the entirety of 2009being so low budgeted one would think that the special effects would not be nearly as well done as a film like transformers revenge of the fallen or harry potter and the half blood prince but rather surprisingly this film has a sense of epic grandeur that begins with a shot of the alien spacecraft near the opening of the film and never fades away so much is done with so little that the story of its production practically begs to be taught in film schools immediately the aliens or prawns as they are referred to are so realistic and lifelike that some shots look even better than those heavily budgeted films they even have their own language inexplicably understandable to humans but so easily used here that it is a great special effect all on its own some of the makeup effects are simply astounding for how authentic and terrifying they look and when the film saunters into being fairly violent the horrific depictions onscreen are almost too genuine district 9 is so polished and so seamlessly edited that one wonders why every movie does not look nearly as well done as this onethe acting as untested and improvised as it is is strong across the board everyone feels natural in their roles and never once do we question their acting abilities copley is the clear standout of the picture expressing a multitude of emotions every chance he gets you would never know this is his first role with just how much effort and ease he appears to be giving i can only hope we will see more of him in the futurethe film has too few faults outside of a few minor plot holes that it almost feels criminal to mention them there are a few character motives and perspectives that feel off in the final act of the film they do not ruin the greatness of the final product but they do detract from it and while the films running time practically soars by there are more than a few things that seem a little too glossed over a good movie always leaves you wanting more but there were a few too many points that went unanswered that easily could have been explained in a piece of dialogue it is a minor quibble but nonetheless takes away from the filmimperfections aside district 9 is one hell of a ride from start to finish some may be turned off by its style but the film is such a great piece of art that any fan of the medium owes it to themselves to see this film it is easily one of the best films of the year now do not ruin it with a sequel 910',\n",

overthetop situations fractured time lines and gallery of memorable characters two multilingual irish lads from south boston awaken one day after they hear the lord tell them to hit the vigilante trail actually despite its farfetched storyline the boondocks saints spouts the message that evil flourishes only when good men look the other way duffy hammers this theme home in an early scene when the minister recaps the reallife tragedy of kitty genovese in 1964 genovese was raped and murdered near her home while thirteen eyewitnesses cowered in either fear or indifference to her plight back and did not intervene consequently the boondocks saints advocates vigilantism unfortunately whatever credibility that duffy generates for his message is obliterated by those kinetically staged gunfights rampant profanity and the melodramatic plot twists basically the boondocks saints is a beer pizza saga that shows some tolerance for homosexuality because one of its chief charactersan erudite fbi agentis gay but not gay is an overthetop way sadly this independently produced actioneer got lost in the politics of its day according to duffy the columbine massacre prompted the distributors to curb release of the film because of its violent fare the heroeswho perform primarily good deedsdress in black like the columbine gunmen and wipe out russian mobsters galore nevertheless this ranks as firstrate entertainment if you enjoy gritty gunplay provocative characters and some surreal staging people who love cats may not enjoy the boondocks saints because a cat is accidentally shot and splattered like a tomato against a wall of course the actual cat was never harmed but some cat lovers cannot differentiate between reality and illusion so this film may leave a dire taste in their mouthsthe cold war has concluded and russian criminals have migrated to america and the russian syndicate is buying up property in boston much to the chagrin of some leaseholders

among them ivan checkov scott griffith walk in to lay down the law and encounter the mcmanus twins connor sean patrick flanery of the suicide kings and murphy norman reedus of deuces wild who precipitate a barroom brawl with them they tied the biggest russian to the bar and set his butt on fire the next day two of the russians including burnt butt barge into their apartment they handcuff

special agent paul smecker willem dafoe of platoon launches an investigation because he is part of the organized crime task force smecker hooks himself up to his portable cd player pops on his disposable gloves and analyzes the crime scene to the strains of classic composer puccinis operatic la bohème although the chronology of the scene is fractured like a tarantino bloodbath duffy appears to invoke the kind of crosscutting that worked so well for hong kong director john woo so that we get to see both the crime and the analysis of the crime later when smecker presents the details of the crime to his colleagues he is in the same shot with our heroes when they perform their community service our heroes give themselves up and smecker lets them go and informs the boston press that they killed the russians in selfdefense later our heroes hear voices and believe that the lord wants them to destroy evil men the macmanus brothers receive help from one of their loony friends david della roc david della roc of jakes corner who serves as an errand boy of sorts for the boston mob he provides our heroes with all the information that they need to start wiping out mobsters with extreme prejudice roc is the crazy one of the bunch and he lacks the focus of the macmanus twins meanwhile smecker investigates each convoluted crime scene and shows the boston police particularly the three detectives on the case dolly david ferry duffy brian mahoney and greenly bob marley why he is such a genius by now our heroes have become saints in the newspapers and they obtain a cache of silenced automatic pistols with which to carry out their work when they ice toplevel hoods connor and murphy utter a prayer while they have their victim on his knees and shoot him through the back of the head so that their bullets exit through the eye sockets afterward they place pennies on the dead mans eyes each execution gets wilder and crazier until the mobsters catch up with them meanwhile smecker has so underestimated the macmanus brothers that he never imagines what they have been doing until roc loses a finger during a shootout and he connects them with roc by this time the mob has declared war on themthe boondocks saints is for actionoriented film fans who know they are only watching a movie sean patrick flanery and norman reedus are perfectly cast as brothers and they kindle a lot of charisma as vigilantes in the tradition of charles bronson from the death wish movies make no mistake however willem dafoe and david della roc steal the show close behind them in his peripheral role

too silly or too long or excessive violence will a tarantino fan crazy as me to realize the enormity of the great masterpiece that django can be not only is one of the best of tarantino movies but it is the tribute that the writerdirector make to his films giving a demonstration of who he is and its materialdjango is arguably the greatest production of tarantino but i know that size does not make the content but greater in everything here we see the combination of the various elements of tarantinos films the title character and history elements are there all together just pay attentionat the beginning we see django jamie fox as a poor simple and sufferer slave who meets the great dr king schultz crhistoph waltz and with him the chance of vengeance of his old owners and later regaining his love broomhilda kerry washington these first 45 minutes of the film we see how django grow both spiritually and mentally and becomes a killing machine that becomes later also in these first few minutes of the film we see elements of kill bill for example the bride of uma thurman a sufferer with visions of the past in search of redemption and revenge against those who took her all what he loved django is her male version and as the bride is an expert on samurai swords django is in revolversin the next two hours we see the plan that django and schultz plan a foolproof plan to recover the wife of django from the cruel calvin candlie leonardo dicaprio a plan that seems to be impossible to know when stephen samuel l jackson in these two hours we see elements of inglourious basterds and pulp fiction from inglourious is the plan that seems foolproof that will lead to an enhuge end with small twists and obstacles ahead along with an intriguing dialog scenes as the dinner scene where the 5 characters are connected in one intriguing line of dialog that leads to the unexpected end such as scene that resembles the scene of the german pub from pulp is the friendly and contradictory partnership between django and schultz that closely resembles the duo vincent and jules two people who are very friendly and respect one another but a small rivalry between the two in what has regarding their attitudes or as schultz says getting dirty the end of the second act delivering the third and final act where the unexpected happens like any tarantino movie a tremendous scale of grandeurdjango might not show a western as we think it would mainly because the film is set in the american south being then a southern but inglourious basterds did not show much of the war and not the situation of the jews only the beginning and focuses attention on killing nazis tarantino uses the environment to explore the southerns slavery that existed in america during the time but at the same time maintaining the elements of a western not getting shot during a firefight a small town with a old sheriff with a dirty past a lone ranger looking for redemptionat the same subject the characters all wellestablished and in them we can see several elements of other tarantino films django seems a mixture of jackie brown the bride and vincent see all alike in gestures and attitudes but also their situation in the whole plot a character a bit shy but very smart and they can even be badass and their situations in the story that almost seems to be a secondary character schultz looks a bit like winnfiel jules pulp fiction and max cherry jackie brown a character cultured with a very particular vision of the world and with his own philosophy of what is good stephen is the mixture of marcellus wallace pulp fiction and ordell robbie jackie brown a n who thinks superior to all others and can be really cruel the only character who seems to be the same original was calvin candie a cynical and cruel slave ownermany complain that django can hardly stands out in the film being the main one but how many times in tarantinos previous films the main character was half out when the secondary characters spoke but here the very minor characters seem to stand out when they talk among themselves when is a scene of schultz calvin begins to talk stealing his scene when is a scene of calvin stephen starts talking and steals his scene when is a scene is stephen schultz starts talking and steals his scene and so it goes on in this dialog triangle of secondary characters and all of them in the badass voice of django appears as a rollercoaster doing everything shake this just proves that tarantino can still do screenplays with mastery and persuasionthe performances of the entire cast can also be fantastic on the style of tarantino jamie fox can install itself in the world of tarantino with a performance that is the beginning of a simpleton slave until its evolution into a badass loneranger chistoph waltz superb as always and once again manages to be the favorite character of the movie for those who attend leonardo dicaprio gives one of his best performances samuel l jackson proving to be one of the best supporting actors in the business all amazing as the movie itselfdjango unchained manages to be one of the funniest films of tarantino but also one of the most intriguing ones with a really well written screenplay a great product delivery that tarantino has always given us and as always challenging and causing controversy in society proving that it still has much to give',\n",

              " 'i am now officially off the m night shyamalan bandwagon nope thats it im through giving him the benefit of the doubt see i really loved the sixth sense thought it was fantastic creepy too i liked unbreakable too sure it was flawed and i could see how some people might not like it but i appreciated with shyamalan was doing and i liked the two lead performances but then signs came and i thought signs was hideously dreadful lacking a sense of humor when it was needed and being way too flippant when the situation called for levity i felt signs was merely a product of an overactive ego and an inactive imagination but i figured that since even the best filmmakers have their vanity movies id forgive shyamalan his signs and looked forward to his next movie well the village isnt much better than signs and thats a real shamethe setting is 1897 in a remote village in the pennsylvania woods its a very quiet unpreposessing village complete with village elders politeness among folk and a oneroom school house these folks look and act amish although thats not specifiedbut this idyllic placid hamlet has a secret see its bordered on all sides by the forest and within the forest are these unspeakable creatures those who shall not be named oddly enough you would think such an appellation would prevent people from openly discussing said creatures but i lost count how many times they were mentioned anyway the creatures were told have a deal with the villagers no villager will cross the perimeter into the forest and no creature will enter the village the villagers have yellow flags around their perimeter and a giant tower with a bell at the top so if and when a creature comes acalling the bell can be rung and people can get to safety the village elders led by edward walker william hurt sincere as always forbid anyone from crossing the perimeter the villagers are also informed that the creatures hate the color red the bad color as its called in hushed whispersweird things have been afoot though small animals have been killed in the village skinned and left to be discovered by openmouthed villagers and when a creature is indeed spotted entering the perimeter the next morning there are slashes of red paint on the doors of peoples homes what could this mean who hath breached the perimeterone man lucius hunt played with openmouth ennui by joaquin phoenix asks the elders for permission to go to a neighboring village to get medicine you see the village is hampered by a distinct lack of medical supplies and when its citizens are quite ill they have no choice but to watch them die theyd prefer this apparently to getting medical suppliesnow any time the phrase only one man pops up in a synopsis of a movie you know you need to relax your curiosity and just let things happen oh here we go you think good il commodus is going to be the one man who can save the villagers from the creatures and themselvesthere are a few twists to the movie so ill halt the synopsis here the trouble is the twists are likely to affect you in one of two ways either youll say i saw that coming or youll merely shrug your shoulders and wonder if the exit door to the theater will open to a part of the parking lot thats a real hike to your car personally i was affected in both waysthe movies simply not well written theres suspense but often its clouded by contrivances in the plot shyamalan wants us to fear the creatures as much as the villagers do but he doesnt succeed were supposed to feel empathy for the villagers but all i could feel was pity and scornthe pacing is pretty tight which is nice since its essential that a suspense movie be well paced but the camera angles often looked amateurish andor auteurish either shyamalan didnt know how to shoot a particular scene or he decided to be cute and make it seem as if the scene had some sort of deep meaning now its true theres a moral to the story here something about you stay on your side ill stay on mine but the tone achieved by the direction didnt really convey that a huge debit too is the soundtrack does shyamalan not know how to use one effectively in most scenes the soundtrack was blaring at such a high volume that the actors could barely be heard whats the point of that exactlyfinally the acting no one is spectacularly miscast although i wonder if adrien brody who won an oscar for goodness sake is kicking himself for agreeing to play the village idiot but no one really shines either how could they with a plot so thin you could read fine print through it most of the actors are well useless they dont do much with what little they have to work with and are essentially wasted especially sigourney weaver hurt is quietly effective but its a role he can play in his sleep by this point newcomer bryce dallas howard is moderately annoying which aint good when you have a very prominent rolethe village is trite and cloying a mishmash of twists that alternately make no sense and make too much sense and can be foretold well in advance m night shyamalan has taken a pretty solid intriguing premise and riddled it with illogic and disdain',\n",
