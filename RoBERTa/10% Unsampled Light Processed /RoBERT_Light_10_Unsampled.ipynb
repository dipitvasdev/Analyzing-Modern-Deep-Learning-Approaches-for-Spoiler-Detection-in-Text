              "[\"This movie is so clich√©, melodramatic, and cheesy. The characters are so terribly one dimensional. Also, they are not at all steeped in reality. Joe Fox is supposed to be some cutthroat businessman, yet you never see even an inkling of that in Hanks' performance. Meg Ryan is over the top cutesy to the point of inducing nausea. This is a business savvy New Yorker? She seems to barely have the wherewithal to tie her shoes let alone own a store. The supporting characters are weak and completely waste the talents of Parker Posey, Greg Kinnear and Steve Zahn (all awesome actors). Even Dave Chapelle sucked, but to be fair he had nothing to work with and had no real character at all. What a waste!Perhaps it is the on screen charisma of Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks that made me watch this inanity to the end. It's bizarre to me that Meg Ryan was nominated for a Golden Globe for this. Her acting strength lies in When a Man Loves and Woman. Anyway, this movie makes for a decent rainy Sunday. I wouldn't pay $$ to stream or rent this. But if it's free - go for it.\",\n",
              " 'The movie \"It\\'s a Wonderful Life\" is one of my favorite holiday movies,despite realizing that it was popular twenty-nine years before I was even born. That can also be a movie to think about any other time of the year besides Christmas. I\\'m saying that because recently, I\\'ve been doing some personal research on a bond between that movie and the lyrics from a song from 1985 by Corey Hart entitled \"Never Surrender\". I know it seems strange to think that there\\'s a common link between an old holiday movie and a song that won\\'t be heard on the radio for nearly forty years after that film\\'s popularity, but I think there is something symbolic between them. I tell you how some of the lyrics goes:Just a little more time is all we\\'re asking forCause just a little more time could open closing doorsJust a little uncertainty can bring you downAnd nobody wants to know you nowAnd nobody wants to show you howSo if you\\'re lost and on your ownYou can never surrenderAnd if your path won\\'t lead you homeYou can never surrenderAnd when the night is cold and darkYou can see you can see lightCause no can take away your rightTo fight and to never surrenderIf anyone reading this knows that song, you might find the reason why I think it\\'s symbolic for other George Baileys out there.Edward G.

              " \"My dad went to see Pulp fiction when it came out in theaters. He saw it four more times after that. I had the honor of watching it with him when I finally turned 18 this May. What can I say about it? The screenplay is brilliant, John Travolta, Uma Thurman, Samuel L. Jackson , and even Bruce Willis knocked it out of the ballpark, and Quentin Tarantino directing is magnificent! Another draw for me was the fact the movie is not told chronologically, making the viewer focus their attention on what's happening down to the minor details. Often I can watch a film and wait a little bit before watching it again, however Pulp Fiction is a rare exception, since I wanna find out what I believe is in the briefcase. Also you can't go wrong if Christopher Walken makes one amazing cameo. Overall, I think this is a wonderful film. As a product of my generation, and loving this movie, it tells me this movie has aged well, and may continue to get better.\",\n",

              " 'Recap: Trevor Reznik suffers from insomnia, in fact he claims not to have slept for a year. And he has lost a lot of weight. So, his life revolves around three places. An all night open caf√© at an airport, a prostitute called Stevie and his work at a factory. It is at the factory he first meets Ivan, an odd character. One day a co-worker asks Reznik to help him, but Reznik gets distracted by Ivan and an accident were the co-worker loses his arm is the result. This is the point were Reznik really start to slip into a strange behavior. Management at the factory claims to know nothing about Ivan and his friends at the factory turns their backs on him. At the same time mysterious messages appear at Rezniks refrigerator. He believes that he is the target of some plot, and that Ivan has the key. But Ivan is hard to catch, and Reznik starts to doubt what is real and what is not.Comments: First, it is a very well made film. The directing is superb, with a lot of hints, clues and references planted around the movie. Use of music, sound effects and visual keys are used in a nice balance. So there is no wrong there. And there is no fault in the acting either. The focus is heavy on Bale/Reznik, and he does it very well. You might actually think that Bale went a little too far with the weight loss, as he is scarily thin in the movie. Well, that\\'s his decision and it do augment the message of Reznik not being very well. In total, I can\\'t actually find any problem with the making of the movie. Instead it is the story that fails. It totally failed to connect, and I found myself not really caring what happened. I sat in the cinema, saw Reznik acting crazy and thought: \"Aha, OK... so what?\". The story lacks the ability to reach out to the audience. I couldn\\'t identify with Reznik, nor could I feel sympathy for him. Actually I didn\\'t have any feelings about what Reznik did that could engage me in the story, not sympathy, not wonder, not anger. Nothing. This movie is proof of that you can do everything right in a production, but still fail. You need the story to carry the movie. Still I hesitantly rate it a 5, only because of the directing and acting.5/10',\n",
              " 'I found it really weird to watch Marlon Brando play a role other than \"The Godfather.\" He is an excellent actor though, and he portrayed the role of Terry beautifully. Terry was definitely the protagonist in this film. Johnny Friendly was the antagonist. It was interesting to view the character of Terry blossom as he goes through the experience of guilt and love simultaneously. This was a classic mobster film and it definitely had a dark and very serious feel to it. A lot of the shots were very dark, even during the day. I didn\\'t notice anything special about the sound of the film. The narrative was continuous and the editing was seamless. The use of the same shot at different points in the movie, the pigeon cage, allowed the viewer to really get in touch with the guilt that Terry was feeling and the emotional torment he was dealing with. I thoroughly enjoyed this film.',\n",
              " 'I had always heard of Charlie Chaplin and saw a little bit of City Lights half way through. I was not really impressed and didn\\'t really care. However I was determined to see Modern Times because I wanted to see what the fuss was about. At first, I wasn\\'t really impressed because I didn\\'t understand what they were doing. I also found the first few minutes pretty boring. I was wondering, \"I thought he was supposed to be FUNNY.\" I even thought of calling this review that. I was not laughing. I felt that way until he does his hilarious signature walk, twirling around the jail. I was feeling very tired and sick at the time and I burst out laughing. I rewound it and I laughed again. That was a turning point. I was beginning to love Charlie Chaplin. Not only was I amazed by his comic genius, but his physically daring (or what would seem so) stunts. My dad and I were amazed at it! We had to rewind several scenes to try and figure out how it worked. It just worked perfectly. Another person who I was impressed with was Paulette Goddard. Although I think she wouldn\\'t have been a good Scarlett, I think she is stunningly gorgeous in this. She really has a screen presence and I loved her in this. Yet another thing that was so relevant was the political element. Charlie Chaplin hits the nail on the head about the industrial situation in those days. So here I am, reflecting on this wonderful movie. Although it took me a little while to get into it, I am now a very big Charlie Chaplin fan. His modern genius amazes me. Not only do I love Chaplin, but this wonderfully told story. I am a Chaplin fan for life.',\n",
              " \"My mate decided to go the cinema this weekend, and I was coming along whether I liked it or not. He suggested that seeing as I had liked Armageddon (I hadn't, I far preferred Deep Impact - similar themed film that was released at the same time), I'd love this.It started so promisingly. The world is contaminated. They're the only survivors. And you get out by winning a lottery to the island, the only non contaminated bit left outside. Except you don't, you're a clone, created to generate bits for someone who is rich and needs them and your number is up when they need or want their transplant.It's not meant to be intellectual and indeed doesn't attempt to be such. It's a no brainer action film, unashamedly so. McGregor leads the show, in style, Johannson is getting better and better in every film she does, by giving a good show with a pretty poor dialogue allocation, whilst Sean Bean is a good bad guy and Buscemi turns in yet another good geek-that's-critical-to-the-plot performance. Michael Clarke Duncan is criminally underused. The actors and actresses are fine. The plot is thin-ish, but fine. The context is definitely fine, original even.And then it gets ruined (and I do mean RUINED) by the amount of product placement that is ridiculously blatant. It got to the point where both me and my mate where counting the amount that we saw.So here goes: We counted McGregor wears Puma Shoes, Aquafina is served at numerous intervals, McGregor's other half drives a tasty looking Cadillac, McGregor and Johannson hitch a lift at one point on a very shiny Mack Truck, X-Box floated in there at one point, there's a big Johnny Rockets logo (you can't miss it), MSN is used to look up Johannson's other half, they use Amtrak to get to LA, Johannson uses AMEX to pay for some ice cream, McGregor's other half uses a Nokia phone to make a video call, plus I've seen Jeremy Clarkson on that nice shiny boat that features a lot as well.It's blatant, and ruins what is otherwise a good 1.5 hr yarn.\",\n",

He says a funny line in almost every quote, and it makes the movie so funny I can watch it over and over again without ever getting bored. Now when thats said, every sentence is so perfectly made, and I realize every time I see the film that something new is in every sentence, that I didn't discover earlier. Some might say though, that some scenes in this movie are a bit stupid perhaps, and with no meaning whatsoever, but I know they where put there for a reason, and they work perfectly well to bind all the scenes together.

              " \"This film is a lot better than others have ranked it. It deserves more than a 6 average. I gave it a 7 and believe it's underrated. The basic story is that years ago, while a child, Robin Williams was transported into the game he was playing at the time and trapped there. Later, two other children find the game board and play it, releasing a now grown up Williams, along with all sorts of dangerous animals and vines and stuff. These things threaten mankind and it's up to Williams, along with Bonnie Hunt, to find a way to stop these things from killing off man. There's a good bit of suspense and with every move the heroic folks make, something counteracts it and things nearly always end up being worse than before. They finally determine that the only way to end the horror is to finish the game that Williams started all those years ago. Now, if they could only find the game board. This is a well written adaptation of a popular book, and I found it quite entertaining.\",\n",
              " \"Weakness. To me, that's what this film is all about. Not the weakness of the women or the drug addicts or dealers or the psycho at the centre of it all, but the weakness of Mike, Jim's friend. He's a guy that's got it all - good looks, a beautiful woman who loves him, a nice house, the prospect of a good job, a future. But he keeps on tossing it all away, out of what - loyalty? No. Addiction? No, he can control his addictions to booze and drugs. Weakness? Yes...he can't say no to his old friend, he can't be seen to be weak, yet every time he says yes, he shows that he is.This aspect of this movie is what really hit home to me. Seen it in myself, seen it in others, ruining one's own life, and one's family life, in order to satisfy the demands of others to whom you feel you owe something, or have to show something...Maybe it's just going for a drink on a Friday night, when you'd promised you'd be home, or you'd promised your daughter you'd pick her up, but you aren't there because you need to show your mates you're one of the boys, or your secretary wants a lift home first, or whatever.Freddy Rodriguez was superb in this movie, and every time I see Christian Bale, I'm more convinced that this is one of the great actors of our time.Hated the movie at first, (all those dawgs and dudes), then grew to love it. A very fine film.\",\n",

However, I really didn't like that, how the Grand Finale of the Hunger Games book series, 2010's Mockingjay; was split into two films (Part 1 in 2014 & Part 2 in 2015) to maximize movie sales. Yes, I do understand, that nobody want to sit & watch a movie with a large extended running time; but in true, the two movies could had been made into one 2 hour film. There were a lot of scenes, that they could had cut to save time, but didn't. Like every other young adult-novel adaptation, this split kinda stinks, because it results in an uneven story-paced. The first part of the adaptation, looks unfinished; while the second part, lacks a good foundation. While Mockingjay, Part 1 explored the use of war propaganda and the politics from chapter 1-12, way too long. This film feels rushed in ending that complex book, as quick as possible, even it seem a bit unrealistic and not well-explained. There are scenes that go way too fast to comprehend in a logical and emotional level. It's not good. They made the films, too thin. Anyways, the story picks up immediately after the conclusion of Part 1 and doesn't waste much time with catching any newcomers up. Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence), is still seeking revenge on President Snow (Donald Sutherland) and his tyrannical government in dystopia future nation of Panem for his crimes against humanity. As she prepares for one final assault against the Capitol. She must find out, who to trust, and where her alliances are. Can Katniss trust the people around her, or will she have to seek revenge on her own? Watch the movie to find out! Without spoiling the movie, too much, I have to say that Part 2 relies so much on showing the main character's burden and her quest for revenge that it comes across as too somber and heavy to some. Personally, I found it, interesting. Jennifer Lawrence beautifully captures the excruciating pain of Katniss' journey, of her loneliness and heartbreak and fierce devotion to those she loves. I love it! While, most of the other actors got sidelined by the story, I have to say, Peeta Mallark (Josh Hutcherson) is not as boring and one-dimension as he used to be. Hutcherson was able to show, how mentally disturb, Peeta can become. Great performance from him, finally. However, the other love-interest, Gale Hawthorne wasn't that well-developed. Gale is just as bland as the day, we first notice him. Being played by Liam Hemsworth doesn't help. He doesn't add, anything new to his performance. Thank goodness, there was less romance than in previous installments. The love triangle is pretty old, and bit annoying, by now. Donald Sutherland is pretty sinister as President Snow. I love his dark presence. Best character, second to Katniss in this film. Other characters like Finnick Odair (Sam Claflin), Johanna Mason (Jena Malone), Effie Trinket (Elizabeth Banks), and Haymitch Abernathy (Woody Harrelson) have significantly reduced roles from the previous installments, but they do what they can, with their screen time. However, I didn't like how Gwendoline Christie's new character Commander Lyme and Stanley Tucci's Caesar Flickerman only get one scene a piece. It's also worth noting that this movie is also Philip Seymour Hoffman's last film to be released following his death in 2014. There are a few moments where it's clear that his character Plutarch Heavensbee was supposed to be present, but Mockingjay, Part 2 does a good job of recovering from his absence and finding new ways to keep him in the movie. However, some of the other changes, they done, were a little bit, more noticeable. Mostly, toward the end, where the movie really skips, over a lot of valuable scenes such as the attempted suicide, trial, incarceration, and mental health recovery from the book to focus more, on a faker happy ever after ending. It was a bit too rushed. Yet, I did like how the movie skip, all the training scenes from the book, as it wasn't really needed. Another thing, that wasn't wanted, was the character of Delly Carwright, whom was wisely, written out of the film. One thing, that was needed, but was missing, is the scene where Katniss accidentally kills an innocent Capitol citizen, while escaping, because its shows how cold-blooded, she can become. Another one, is how Primrose Everdeen (Willow Shields) got to the Capitol. Her presence toward the end, seem to come out of the blue, and wasn't well-explain. Yet, there are other scenes, I wish, the filmmakers would had cut, like any of the animal mutations scenes. Those scenes delves too much into horror/sci-fi film territory. It was too weird. Even its color palate, remind me of a horror movie. Sometimes, a scene is filmed so dark that you can't tell where the action is taking place or even which character is dying. I felt like I was watching a different movie, like Island of the Dr. Moreau or Aliens, because of that. Despite that, the movie was still entertaining. I like how oddly mix, the serious urban warfare was with the cartoony booby traps of the future, even if it didn't merge well. While there's much less bloody hand-to-hand fighting, the violence can still be intense and upsetting. Lots of dead and severely wounded people for a PG-13 movie. Overall: This fourth and final installment in The Hunger Games film series, was a satisfying conclusion, despite some flaws. In my opinion, very few book series have received such a faithful, fabulously performed, and visually appealing set of cinematic adaptations. Fans of the book series should be happy, at least for that.\",\n",

It is kinda nostalgic.The setting of the Zone is great, it is beautiful and creepy at the same time. The fog is amazing, the setting is really amazing. It doesn't feel staged, it looks really natural.Stalker is movie with gloomy mood. The director, Andrei Tarkovsky is Ingmar Bergman fan-boy....so yeah, now you know why and I hate Ingmar Bergman, so for me Stalker is just an OK filmBut I think he made better story than Bergman, his setting and cinematography arguably better than Bergman.If you are a movie fan that interested in the history of movie, yes you should watch this. If you are not, than just skip this movie.7/10\",\n",

Having made my point, i also state that the general success of this movie lies in the actors performances. It is so believable that you almost think, maybe they\\'re going through these situations in real life or their participation in the movie is actually depressing, as that, \"depression\" is always almost visible in the main characters\\' (portrayed by mulligan&fassbender)appearances.

But sometimes, words matter even if its just a sentence&i truly believe at least a bit more should have been said in this heart wrenching movie to make the viewer totally fall into the lives&fully understand these characters better. Scenery, camera usage, close up shots, wonderful! This movie opens up your mind to a million things, leaving you with questions you might not be able to answer yourself. I won\\'t suggest this movie as a form of therapy for a \"wanting to escape\" sex addict because i don\\'t think it will work, but for those who might be curious to see what sex addiction is like, the pains associated with it(and any other form of addiction)&the possible damages it can cause, depression, wrong family background/child upbringing, yes i would.

To see beloved characters turned into a joke and keep watching it... Not to mention the resemblance of the story to Star wars. Which is just slap in a face, because there were so many other ways to make new star trek movie, and they go for SW ripoff. I won\\'t go into all the other stuff, cause many other reviewers mentioned a lot of it. My biggest problem is lack of real star trek story, and trying to replace it with effects and violence. 150 000 000 dollars and this is all you could think of?Why would someone who hates Star trek be given a chance to make this joke of a movie whose only connection to trek are the names. Why not make another generic blockbuster that (just like this one) has nothing to do with Star trek at all, names included?It wouldn\\'t make so much profit i guess, cause some John Doe in space with cgi and mindless action scenes would get as much attention as any other blockbuster and then would be forgotten.And here\\'s another one: JJ and company thinks this movie will bring in new fan base, so he can dispose of the old one. Here\\'s some news for him: it won\\'t. For new \"fans\" this is as important as Transformers. I predict much smaller audience for sequel since many Trekkie\\'s will boycott it and new \"fans\" will forget about it, go to Transformers VI, or something.I gave it 1, i\\'d give it -100 if i could.',\n",

              " 'I have rarely spent such a boring time at the movie theater, as there is so little substance to this film past the color special effects. Five minutes into the movie, you find yourself mentally screaming at the screen: \"WE GET IT! You wanted to replicate the printed version verbatim!\". And this film solely relies on this trick to entertain. There is really little more to this film than the color gimmick. Unfortunately, the writers/director did not want to put one second of thought into how to adapt the printed version for the screen. A comic is not the same thing as a movie. You need to put some depth into the characters, the situations, the story, mostly because films have this ability to carry a enormous amount of information, details, imagery, and audiences expect it as such. Here, the people in charge simply chose to transpose everything as is, hence the enormous void of story, detail, content, and why the whole thing moves at a murderously slow pace.And such a waste of so many good actors. A bunch of nobodies could have done the trick just as well. Somehow you can see how they have no real idea what to do, where to go, what their purpose is, and just in for the paycheck.This film could have been a glory of style over content, if only the style didn\\'t bore beyond the first 5 minutes.',\n",

I didn't attach to them even though I had seen lots of the other MCU movies. The performances are good but nothing amazing. RDJ is good as Iron Man but I just don't like the character. I didn't care about any of them and Coulsons death was boring and I didn't care for the character.Villain Loki was good but not great as a villain. He is by far a good villain but isn't very threatening which is the main point of the villain. He wasn't even a threat until the Chitauri turned up and they could have been taken down by the army. Plot This is the main reason that this is overrated. It has no plot. It is very simple but still has plot holes. The main threat of the movie is actually very easy to take down so the Avengrrs aren't needed whatsoever. They could have been defeated but the army and if they were a threat to the world why didn't they even make it past ONE CITY. Most of the time plot holes are created by us not thinking right and using common sense but these plot holes are gigantic. Summary What I liked: characters, villain, effects and action What I disliked: plot, music and villains army. Overall this is very overrated and so it gets a: 5.4/10\",\n",

              " \"I, Robot is set in Chicago, 2035 where the headquarters of US Robotics is located. US Robotics is the largest manufacturer of robots in the world & the use of Robot servants by humans is common, the Robots are governed by three laws which prevent them from harming a human but homicide detective Del Spooner (Will Smith) is suspicious of them. Spooner then gets a holographic message from US Robotics founder & Robot creator Dr. Alfred Lanning (James Cromwell) who has recently committed suicide. Del suspects that Lanning discovered something about his Robots & that they killed him but no-one believes him. Together with Robot psychologist Dr. Susan Calvin (Bridget Moynahan) detective Spooner investigates Lannings suicide & becomes convinced it was murder & that the Robots which are everywhere & in almost every home in the world are planning something...This American German co-production was originally developed under the title Hardwired & was directed by Alex Proyas, I must admit I actually really rather liked this big budget CGI laden Sci-Fi action blockbuster. Apparently taking the works of Isaac Asimov (the Robotic three laws in particular) as inspiration the script by Jeff Vintar & Akiva Goldsman starts off in intriguing murder mystery fashion, an old school detective thriller set in the future as it were but then with about thirty odd minutes to go it turns into the predicted overblown noisy Hollywood action vehicle which is fine since I suppose that's all anyone really expected it to be anyway. The neat murder mystery elements are a good bonus while they last & I liked I, Robot more when it was dealing with the murder & various conspiracies than when it decides to go down the huge action set-piece route. The character's are a bit thin on the ground & it takes Will Smith to really carry the film which he does. Love him or loathe him one has to say he sure has made some great films & his acting is getting better, I must admit I thought he was great in I, Robot & he turns Spooner into a really charismatic likable hero with plenty of amusing one-liners & quips. I loved the exchange he has with Dr. Calvin where she ask's if he has 'Ever had a normal day?' to which he replies 'Yeah, once. It was a Thursday'. Well it made me laugh anyway. The film has a good pace, it moves along in a logical & interesting way which keeps you watching & overall it's an effective & enjoyable futuristic thriller.The vision of the future that I, Robot paints is actually very hard to believe if you think about it, upright walking Robotics is more or less dead & has no practical use. Even now there's no great desire or need for Robots like the ones in the film & they wouldn't work in reality as in the film anyway. I, Robot is packed with CGI computer effects, in fact I would bet there aren't too many scenes which don't feature some sort of optical effect. While they look nice enough & are animated with great detail you just know that what your looking at is a CGI computer graphic. Not once during I, Robot did I actually think I was looking at a real Robot. There are some good set-pieces including a house being demolished while Will Smith is still inside it, there's some nice motorbike stunts, an expensive looking CGI sequence set in a tunnel where Will Smith in his car is attacked by dozens of Robots & a dizzying final sequence set inside a huge computer core control room.With a supposed budget of about $120,000,000 I, Robot had the budget of a small country at it's disposable (although Will Smith apparently got paid $28,000,000) so as one would expect it looks great with expensive looking CGI, big set-pieces, immaculate production design & a really clean futuristic look. Apparently Denzel Washington was offered the role of Del Spooner, luckily he either didn't accept it or he was replaced & I doubt I, Robot would be as much fun without Will Smith. The rest of the acting is alright although no-one is given much to do.I, Robot is a fun big budget blockbuster that I must admit I really liked, at the end of the day it's nothing more than good fun but what else do you want? Thanks to a charismatic performance from Will Smith & plenty of action I say this one is well worth a watch. According to the IMDb I, Robot 2 (2010) is currently in development.\",\n",
              " \"Where do I begin? A complete let down, just like the other two. Although I do have to admit that of the three, this is the best one. However that really is not saying much. There was no need for the Wookiee's to scream the Tarzan yell. R2D2 getting a fight scene? Had George Lucas really run out of idea's that he had to give R2D2 a fight scene? And no star wars prequel would be complete with out the cheesy dialog. And for the CGI, well we all know how off and poorly done the last two movies were, the same applies here, and it especially shows when they are on the Lava Planet. You get pumped that they are finally bringing in the Wookiee's. Who just like Darth Maul, have a total of 10 minute screen time...if that. And how about in Epidsode 2 where George sets it up that Boba Fett was going to be the one to kill Mace, after he witnessed Mace beheading his father. And absolutely no Boba Fett! Never mind Boba Fett, how about the fact that there were no Mandalorian Soldiers in the movie at all?! I would like to know why there is an animated movie that you need to watch before Episode 3 so that you understand the General Grievous story? There was never an animated movie to connect Empire and Jedi. And Padme goes from telling Anakin that she is pregnant to practically full term in the next scene. Speaking of Padme, another scene that clearly shows that Mr. Lucas ran out of ideas, Padme died because she lost the will to live due to a broken heart. Give me a break! Fans did not wait over 30 years for this stupid lame excuse of a death scene as to why Luke and Leia's mother had died. Another example of the horrible script writing was the lack of thought put into the reason the Emperor now looks the way he does. Although I do have to give credit to the light saber and space battle scenes. At least you didn't blink and they were over, they actually almost held a candle to the originals. The only part of the movie that I enjoyed watching was the transformation of Anakin into Darth Vader, which isn't until the last 45 minutes of the movie. I felt that this movie was a total let down, and I hope that George does not get the bright idea to do Epidsoes 7, 8, and 9. I want my money back!\",\n",

              " 'A lot of TV time has been given to historians and other scholars criticing this movie, a bit, for some of its \"factual\" lapses. Benjamin Martin, the Mel Gibson character, was really Somebody Else Martin-- an actual historical figure of that time known as the \"Swamp Fox.\" Kicked a lot of English butt, and was a hero of his generation. As mores and values change over time, dramatic devices and details must also change to evoke the same feelings in the audiences of future generations.That is, what might have thrilled the 18th and 19th century Americans to hero worship might now merely bore or even appall. Thus a few \"facts\" must be changed for dramatic purposes-- Martin is now NOT a slave holder, was goaded by personal tragedy inflicted by the English, etc. But this does represent, perhaps, the same feelings. Thus, while the facts of the history might be a little bit different here and there, the realities for the people actually involved, their feelings, and thus the real lives of those depicted, is in reality very true, and very correct. This might have been what the author of the book this was based on meant when he said recently: \"I don\\'t let the facts get in the way of the truth\" (or something close to that).From a Hollywood standpoint-- a good movie or not, etc., this is top notch entertainment. And all the hub-bub over facts notwithstanding, much of the period was actually displayed quite accurately-- the movie was shot in the same locales as many of the events of 1776-1781. The uniforms, guns, and tactics of the opposing sides were also accurately shown-- much of the technical expertise coming from historians and \"re-enactors,\" folks who devote years of their lives to reproducing the military look and behaviors of historical periods.In case some people wonder about Mel Gibson playing an early American patriot in the movie-- is there anyone left who doesn\\'t yet know that Gibson was born and raised in the good ol\\' USA? He only went to high school and college in Australia, consciously learning and adopting an Australian accent to avoid being beaten by his teenaged Australian hosts. Upon returning to America, his accent has been flushed away, leaving his original New York state American standard inflection.You might see a bit of \"Braveheart\" in some of the action. Hey-- when all is said and done, this IS a movie. I am curious about one thing-- Do the English allow Mel Gibson movies to be shown unedited in their country?

              " 'I remember it was in 1996, on the news, I saw that the actress Elizabeth Berkeley known for her role as Jessie Spano in \"Saved by the Bell\", was elected Worst Actress of the Year. It was my discovery of the Razzies awards and a timely one since \"Saved by the Bell\" was aired at that time and I didn\\'t realize it then that there could be something as bad acting, or I never really paid much attention to it. But I\\'ll never forget the clip they showed: it was that weird nervous smile after getting an indecent proposal from an Asian businessman, yes it was cringe-worthy even out of context.I never really cared about the film given its trashy and trashed reputation, but now that it\\'s been critically re-evaluated and perceived as a satire of some sort, even compared to an exploitation version of \"All About Eve\", I thought it was time to see where I stood, especially since I didn\\'t see the film before so my opinion would be neutral.But to be honest, I don\\'t see any connection with \"All About Eve\" except if we mean the nudity. On that level, \"Showgirls\" shows no limit, just when you think you\\'ve got enough breast-flashing, bottom-shaking, pole dancing and many other on-your-nose sexiness, you\\'re served another ration. It\\'s to Berkeley\\'s credit to have wanted to distance herself from her good-girl image, but she couldn\\'t have picked a worse role.It\\'s not about the nudity or the cruel abuse she\\'ll be victim of (more on a verbal level), Ned Beatty became a star thanks to his ungrateful role in \"Deliverance\", but the problem in Elizabeth\\'s character, Nomi, besides her name, is that nothing is ever made to make the audience root for her except for the fact that she\\'s the main protagonist. What she needed was a little more exposition or scenes where she could talk of something else than \\'sex\\' or \\'not being a hooker\\' or anything to make her a three-dimensional character, a person. Nomi wasn\\'t a person, she was a foil for a director who made to make a movie about the sleazy underground world of titty-entertainment.So, if not the best performance ever, Berkeley as Nomi is one of the bravest... in a career-suicidal way.Is she bad? Yes, but I guess she was misguided by Verhooven\\'s approach to the idea of what Nomi should have been: a former drug-addict with a hair-trigger temper. From the very start; she sets the tone of her character\\'s annoying unpredictability. She was so irritating I even wasn\\'t noticing her acting, but rather Nomi\\'s acting, and then it hit me. This is a film made by a guy and for guys, it doesn\\'t give a rat\\'s ass about women and in a way, it\\'s very karmic that the film destroyed Berkeley\\'s career and all the others continued making films. Verhooven, McLachlan, they didn\\'t attract the same venom as the one who was under the spotlight: Berkeley, even Gershon played in the more successful \"Face-Off\" two years later.The film is exactly a sort of \"Casino\" where the bad guys would win at the end, maybe it\\'s honest and blunt but the film can only show these girls as lambs sacrificed at the altar of men\\'s greed and sexual lust. The way girls are treated would make anyone cringe, especially at our time where even \"undesired hugs\" can push someone to take a leave of absence. I bet even a striptease club manager would be sued if he acted like that prick in the casting scene. It\\'s not enough to insult them, but a tap on the shoulders, really? Women are patronized and insulted and reduced to a sex-cattle and it carries a certain truth and make even a guy root for a girl, and makes some of Nomi\\'s reactions acceptable and bad-ass once you get past the acting (she\\'s not always bad anyway).But it\\'s because we care for Nomi -she\\'s weird but interesting, she\\'s annoying but she stands for herself- that it\\'s infuriating how the story takes many directions and you never really get whatever is wrong with her, or even right. It\\'s like whatever you can get can only be accidental, as if the film could only be good despite itself. It\\'s a shame because Berkeley sure has the moves and makes a convincing showgirl but the directing and her character-coaching were so lacking. I checked the French version of the film and seriously, Berkeley\\'s performance is almost decent, so it\\'s not just her body language but her voice that was problematic. I believe it could have been fixed.Instead, the narrative structure is all messed up and never allows Berkeley to give her character a human density, she just yells, cries, runs away, acts badly with people who treats her nice, gets on stage, leaves stage, and she dances, teases customers, and insists on not being called a hooker as if at that point of the movie, the distinction made a difference. The film was made the same year than \"Casino\" and \"Leaving Las Vega\" \"and both Sharon Stone and Elizabeth Shue provided more interesting characters who were supposed to be hookers. At least, they really hook you, in \"Showgirls\", there\\'s not a single hook to latch onto.Maybe Verhoovendidn\\'t bother to provide one, maybe he didn\\'t care about the audiences, only the audience to drool over the beautiful sight without caring for the story, embodying the very sleaziness the film supposedly denounces. As a result, \"Showgirls\" is only a big, bland and dull teaser... with Berkeley\\'s acting career as a collateral damage.',\n",
              " 'I went to see Journey to the center of earth. But I never saw it in 3-D. That is probably what has changed my opinion on this film. I have been thinking for a long time on what to rate this movie. I have now come to a conclusion.The film was a disappointment. Surely it was better than Land of the lost but man it was a little stupid. I am sure that when they made it they were intending on a film with brains. This is an entertaining film. But certainly not art.The film occasionally aims for laughs. It has a couple but can\\'t quite make it. It seems a little too short. Just a little. I will give it to them for visuals. and I will give it to them cause, though there is about an 85 minute length there isn\\'t 30 boring seconds. Alright, the film is silly. But it works to some extent. 3-D might have been a different story. I like Brendan Fraser. I always have. But none of his films in 2008 were spectacular. But he did have a comeback. Though I for some reason enjoyed The Mummy 3. My original rating on this film was a 6. Then I realized that I didn\\'t like The Mummy more than this. So I upped it a little.The story: Well, it\\'s not based on Jules Verne\\'s classic tale. It\\'s about a professor named Trevor Anderson. His brother went missing many years ago. When his nephew Sean(played by Josh Hutchinson) visits, they discover notes inside the book\"Journey to to the center of the Earth\" and realize that he might have been up to something.So the two of them travel down to God knows where to find the entrance. With the help of some chick, they travel down to the center of the Earth on accident. Of course. And try to find their way back home.The actors are likable. Or at least Fraser and Anita Briehm are. So is Josh Meyers, though he isn\\'t in it much. The film is just stupid fun. Though at times a little cheesy(which I hate most in a movie), and a little ridiculous(obviously), but I still think it\\'s worth seeing.Journey to the center of the Earth: B',\n",

This was the place where they would either bring it back or go completely in the wrong direction. Unfortunately, they went completely in the wrong direction. The Hobbit story is a good story. I read it when I was young and I know many others who did or at least tried as well. They only criticism I'd ever heard was that Tolkien could be a little dry. But it was a good story and there was no need to change it so drastically. I understand that they were trying to develop subplots in order to extend the story and stretch it into 3 movies, but please. I wonder if the people responsible for writing the screenplay ever actually read the book or just the Cliffs Notes version. If they had actually read the book, they would have seen that there was plenty of story there for 3 movies without ruining the story. But they didn't. So yes, they ruined the story. I don't post a lot of reviews, but in this case I couldn't resist. I guess we'll have to wait for someone else to come along perhaps 30 or 40 years from now to do it right. Until then we can watch the animated version and pretend this movie doesn't exist.I gave it a 6 because the visuals and effects were very cool. The dragon was great. 6 might be generous. I give it about a 4 for what they did to the story and 8 for visuals. The average is 6..\",\n",
              " \"At first, I thought this series showed slim to non staying power, it was just to simple. Brothers find something strange, do some research, kill the bad ghost, and that was it. But after a while, the underlying story came more and more into play, and with that, the show started to flourish. The chemistry between the two brothers is excellent, especially in the later seasons, when Sam is not such a whiny b*tch all the time. The show doesn't take itself to seriously, which is good, otherwise I think it would be stuck in the wannabe X-files category, instead, it has a much lighter take on the supernatural, and some episodes you could almost classify as pure comedy.All in all, it's one of the most entertaining shows I've seen in the last few years, and I hope they don't ruin it in season 4, which I'm a little afraid of, I just don't know how they can solve the Dean-problem without it getting way to hocus pocus.\",\n",
              " 'The murder of President John F. Kennedy on November 22nd. 1963 was perhaps the greatest tragedy to have visited the United States of America. The question was asked of young and old alike, \\'Where were you when you heard, They Just Shot President Kennedy?\\' There are many theories concerning the assassination of so beloved a popular president, but none that has truly satisfied the listening public. In this film called \" J. F. K \" director Oliver Stone attempts to explain the reason for Kennedy\\'s death and the cover up which followed. With the use of great actors such as Kevin Costner, Jack Lemmon, Walter Mathau, Ed Asner, Joe Pesi, Tommy Lee Jones and a dozen others, Stone\\'s monumental task is seen for what it is, A Classic Work of Art. It\\'s true, the American public will never uncover the truth behind the actual killing, but this film does allow for a better understanding of who might have profited from the great man\\'s death. Audiences across the nation are given the hidden agenda and the men responsible for their cowardly deed. This three hour movie explains in meticulous detail of how the assassination was carried out and how The Warren Report botched the investigation. There are many reasons why we will never know, but one thing remains true, those presidents who are not as popular or loved by the public as President Kennedy, need never fear the magic bullet. This movie becomes part of our history and a living legacy towards a final tribute to John F. Kennedy.',\n",

It ended up just being boring. The intro seemed forced or contrived. The directing was pretty good. The anti-hero was so cruel he didn\\'t seem real at all. The costumes were the best part. The conclusion made me go \"Is that it?

              " \"PURSUIT OF Happiness is a film that despite all its flaws (repetition of chases, repeated encounters that mirror the last, emotional overload, excessive playing time of two hours, etc) reinforces some truly important human values: love between a father and son, pushing forward toward success despite all the roadblocks, kindness for the plight of the homeless, and strength of character in the face of hopelessness. Knowing that the story (by Steve Conrad) is based on fact, that Chris Gardner really existed to survive these hardships, makes the film even more impactful. Director Gabriele Muccino knows how to aim for the heart and the film is bound to touch all who view it.Chris Gardner (Will Smith) is an African American very bright young man married to Linda (Thandie Newton) who has a difficult time working double shifts at a thankless job to support the family due to Chris' inability to sell Bone Density Evaluators that he used the family's life savings to invest in for a future that looks increasingly grim. Chris and Linda and their young son Christopher (Jaden Christopher Syre Smith) live next to the poverty line and finally Linda leaves, frustrated, angry and hurt. Chris and his son strike out on their own: the relationship between father and son as enacted by the Smiths is as touching as any on film. Bruised by the lack of success in selling his machines, Chris encounters a happy man who says his secret is working as a stockbroker with Dean Witter in downtown San Francisco. Chris applies for employment, passes an entrance exam and is taken on with the firm - only to discover he is an unpaid intern who must pass a hefty exam and perform at top speed in order to succeed.With no income except from Chris' continued attempts to see his medical machines poverty embraces the father and son and they end up homeless and hungry. The only things keeping Chris afloat are his love and concern for his son and his intense will to survive and succeed. How this works out is known because of all the PR from the film and from the actual facts of the story.Will Smith and his son Jaden give warmly human performances, giving the camera as much with the silence of their faces as they deliver with lines. Yes, there are many moments when the heartstrings are heavily plucked, but there is no problem defending that in a society too famished for stories of human dignity in the face of tragedy. The large supporting cast is well directed and the production values are excellent. PURSUIT OF Happiness is well worth the journey. Grady Harp\",\n",

              " 'The near universal critical acclaim for \\'Looper\\' is something I\\'m having a hard time fathoming. I suppose we haven\\'t seen a great sci-fi thriller in such a long time, that as soon as a mediocre to average flick such as this one comes along, everyone is jumping on the bandwagon, practically calling it a masterpiece! My first problem with \\'Looper\\' is the overall concept. A crime syndicate in the future (2074)wants to dispose of its victims by sending them 30 years back into the past and have them disposed of by hit men, who they pay with bars of silver. Once these hit men (the loopers) live their lives for thirty years, the syndicate decides to dispose of them by sending them back to 2044, where they\\'ll be disposed of, sometimes even by their younger selves.It\\'s explained that in the future bodies are \\'tagged\\' so by sending them back in time, they cannot be traced. But why can\\'t the syndicate send their victims in the present immediately back to 65 million B.C. where they would probably be immediately eaten by a dinosaur or other prehistoric animal, thus preventing the time-line from being tampered with? And by cutting out the middlemen (i.e. the loopers) in this way, the syndicate can keep all the profits for themselves.Once we\\'re introduced to the novelty of the how the looper scheme operates, the novelty soon wears off. We see Joe (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) traveling to the cornfield and then performing executions one too many times. Finally, there\\'s a plot twist: fellow looper Seth appears at Joe\\'s apartment, explaining that his 30 year old self from the future appears in the cornfield and he\\'s unable to finish the job. Abe, the enforcer from the future, forces Joe to betray Seth, who\\'s tortured and his alter ego from the future is hunted down. You might ask what this has to do with time travel or science-fiction. Actually nothing--it\\'s simply all action-thriller at this point in time in the script.Soon, Joe finds himself in the same position as Seth. His 30 year old future self (Bruce Willis) appears but manages to prevent younger Joe from doing him in. In a rather derivative idea borrowed from the \\'Terminator\\' series, Willis must dispose of a child who will one day grow up to be the \\'Rainmaker\\', the sinister figure in the future who is now bent on eliminating all the loopers.It might have been interesting had we seen what this Rainmaker character looked and acted like in the future, but that never occurs. We\\'re asked to be content with meeting little Cid, our future Rainmaker, who has telekinetic powers coupled with a severe anger management problem. One is immediately reminded of Billy Mumy in the Season 3 Twilight Zone episode, \"It\\'s a Good Life\", who plays a mutant who terrifies adults by \\'wishing them away to the cornfield\\'. So the second half of \\'Looper\\' feels much more like fantasy-horror than Sci-fi action thriller.The meeting between the younger and older Joes in the diner is perhaps the most interesting scene in the film as it underscores the contrast between the more impulsive younger self with the more seasoned, experienced older one. Unfortunately, there is hardly any additional interaction between the two altar egos, with older Joe stalking off to blow away Abe and his crew of malevolent meanies. In true Bruce Willis fashion, the aging \\'Die Hard\\' legend, is up to his old tricks, by machine-gunning most of the bad guys, sans Kid Blue, who appears out of nowhere on his flying motorcycle and immediately gets himself killed, instead of Joe, who is his intended target.If the Looper second half feels a bit slower than the first, that\\'s because director Rian Johnson spends a little too much time out on the farm, with Joe courting Sara (Emily Blunt). Although there\\'s a feeling that we\\'ve seen this before, the ending proves to be passable as we finally have something to feel good about. Younger Joe sacrifices himself, preventing older Joe from killing Sara. He does this after he\\'s able to foresee that Cid, growing up as the Rainmaker, will hold a perpetual grudge due to the murder of his mother and will take it out on all of humanity (including all the loopers) in the future.Unfortunately, Joe\\'s sacrifice, is not enough to make either young Joe or older Joe, likable. Younger Joe, before he takes his own life, is a criminal and a drug addict and older Joe, is responsible for murdering the second child on his list of three potential Rainmakers. In terms of a sympathetic protagonists, there\\'s little to like here at all.\\'Looper\\' is also unable to score points with its look at the dystopian future. One feels that one is simply viewing a second hand set from \\'Robocop\\'--in that film, \\'Old Detroit\\' looks remarkably similar to Looper\\'s Kansas City of 2044 including the grimy \\'futuristic\\' cars and emphasis on vagrancy as a national blight.The performances in Looper are all acceptable, with an honorable mention going to little Pierce Gagnon as Cid, who manages to handle a number of complicated lines and take direction in a fashion way above his chronological age.In the end, Looper proves only mildly interesting. While some of the action sequences are entertaining, the sci-fi premise is not developed into something clever enough to deserve all the the accolades that have been heaped upon it to date.',\n",

From the story to the climax of the film you are given a thrill ride and story driven film.The Dinosaurs feature in the film are Tyrannosaurus Rex,Velociraptors, Triceratops, Parasaurolophus, Brachiosaurus, Dilophosaurus, and Gallimimus they are detail to make them look and feel like real Dinosaurs it still a beautiful piece of art to see how well they give these animals justice and gave movie fans a wonderful look into how these animals might have been in the past. Real and C.G.I. The Dinosaurs are just amazing to watch on screen. The movie brought something for everyone from thriller action scenes to moments that made your heart race the film deliver on so many levels with the infamous Break out Scene of the T-Rex to the Raptors in the kitchen Jurassic Park has created some of the greatest moments in movie history that leaves you on the edge of your seat at the same time be in awe by the film\\'s impressive work of art.The cast worked very well together to bring the story to life and they pick the right stars for these roles, Sam, Laura, Jeff, Richard and everyone made the character memorable along with classic lines from the film like \"Welcome To Jurassic Park\" \"Hold onto your Butts\" \"Ah ah ah you didn\\'t say the magic word\" Music in Jurassic Park is just phenomenal with Mr.John Williams doing the score for the film anything he touches with his music turns to gold his music is like listening to a story and it just beautiful. Every piece of music he wrote for this film is masterpiece in their own right such as \"Welcome To Jurassic Park\" \"Dennis steals the embryos\" \"Remembering Petticoat Lane\" \"A Tree for my bed\" the music just fits the film perfectly.I can\\'t find nothing bad to say about Jurassic Park it is just one of the greatest films ever created and one I can watch over and over still love it. It\\'s just one of those films you can\\'t help but respect. I give Jurassic Park an perfect 10 out of 10Welcome To Jurassic Park',\n",

I used to watch the old western movies, where the heroes were the likes of Custer and villains were the Native Americans killing settlers and soldiers.Of course now we all know about the genocide that was the settling of the Americas. To this day I refuse to have anything to do with the Catholic religion, because it was forced on us by the missionairies. Because back then it was convert or die by being burned alive or whatever punishment they could come up with.If it weren't for a handful of priests all the written texts of the Mayas would have been burned in bonfires all because they were considered the work of the devil.I would love to see more movies like this where we are portrayed as fathers taking care of their families, protecting them from enemies and even giving up our lives to allow a friend to live on.\",\n",

This movie has everything from drama to comedy to anger to everything a good movie has. It deals with so many subjects and it deals with them all brilliantly. This is both his most funny movie, and his most beautiful movie, once again Wes made me laugh and cry more then any movies I have seen in a long time. If you have watched this movie I am sure you know what I am talking about, and if you didn't like the movie you probably won't like this review since I only have positive things to say about it. But if you haven't watched this movie yet, do it as soon as possible and I can promise you won't be disappointed.Even if you don't like comedy movies I can almost guarantee this movie will make you change your mind about the genre, before I knew Wes Anderson I also didn't know how amazing comedy movies can actually be. Anyway this movie is amazing and here are the reasons why. First the story is amazing, it has a perfect mix of drama and comedy without ruining the movie.It is true that serious comedy's tends to be bad, but trust me this movie does it perfectly. People who say comedy movies can't be serious, or serious movies can't be funny, clearly don't know the any Wes Anderson movies. I won't go in to the story but I will say it is one of the best stories I have seen in my entire life, no kidding. Wes Anderson does an amazing job as director, if I could talk to him about the movie all I could say is, thanks for this amazing masterpiece, you couldn't have done it better. The acting is amazing, there are some surprisingly good roles from usually not so great actors like, Ben Stiller, Owen Wilson, and a couple others. And there are some amazing performances by some truly great actors like, Gene Hackman, Gwyneth Paltrow, Bill Murray, Anjelica Houston, and many others. This movie will without a doubt go down in history as a masterpiece, and it would deserve no less, because this is really one of the greatest comedy movies ever made.

              " \"Its simply fun. No matter what age you are or even if you aren't a comic book fan you will still enjoy this movie because we can all relate to it. Its about fitting in and the want to be special. To say the acting is superb would be an understatement, the story is slick and well paced, the direction is flawless and it all comes together in a magnificent and epic way. Do NOT miss this movie, its great fun and Michael Fassbender's acting itself pays for the movie ticket. Kevin Bacon is excellent as the devious Sebastian Shaw, James McAvoy is great as the charismatic Xavier and all female actors did a great job with their characters with the expection of January Jones but I doubt most people will complain. Like I said, go watch it, it might be one of the best superhero movies ever made\",\n",
              " \"There is no reason for this entire movie. Other than the acting, which was good, this movie is a total waste. The story has too many flaws and holes in it. 3:10 to Yuma is every bit as uninteresting as The Assassination of Jesse James. It's overwrought, loaded down with the same thing over and over -- long periods of tough talk, followed by shooting their way out of an impossible situation. Then more chatter followed by another implausible escape from death. It has all the cartoonishness of an Indiana Jones movie. If they had just shot Russell Crowe when he first gets arrested, the director could have called it a day and saved us all 2 hours.\",\n",

              " 'As a huge fan of the original Ghostbusters I was willing to give this film a go. The advertising for it alone was a buzz kill for me, the whole \"Female centric\" and \"Girl power\" thing was completely unnecessary (Since when does that matter in a film?). I can\\'t complain about the acting, the cast or cinematography they were all fine but it was blatantly agenda ridden. I interpreted all the male characters as either complete idiot buffoons or douchebags whereas the female characters are intelligent and quirky and what not. I have too many issues with this film but i\\'ll only touch on a few. Lets start with the final boss *spoils ahead* the final boss was a personification of the original Ghostbusters logo, when i saw this it made all the \"This film ruined my childhood\" comments make sense. Literally the new Ghostbusters attack the image of the old Ghostbusters, rude much? To partially take down the boss the girls shoot him in the crotch, tell how that doesn\\'t go along with the whole agenda thing. Men often are the focus of the jokes in this film, Chris\\'s character being a big oaf who has the same number of brain cells as people in a monogamous relationship, the takeout delivery boy still manages to be late even when the busters live upstairs. There is no real connection between this ghostbusters and the original except for the name, the image and the concept of catching ghosts. The cameos were brief and understated. There was no passing the mantle to the new buster, the girls just incidentally invent all the same technology and images. I have never deadpanned through an entire film before. It just wasn\\'t funny and i left the film utterly saddened by this failure of a reboot. I\\'ll just stick to the originals.',\n",
              " 'I would definitely say this movie was way better than the first film, which definitely tells you what? See this movie. Every single thing was well put together and interestingly plotted and organized into one stylish action-packed thriller. This film had better acting than the first one, even though the first had pretty good acting, there was more action and the characters were stronger than ever. The new \"villian\" is played very well and I think he replaced Magneto for half the film well.We are now joined with a new group of characters. We have Pyro, played by the gorgeous and extremely talented Aaron Stanford, he did an x-cellent job, Alan Cumming as Kurt Wagner, I would say his performance was way superior, Brian Cox as William Stryker, the new \"villian\", and Kelly Hu as the small part of Lady Deathstrike. The small performances by say Colossus were good even though he only had a line or two. Anna Paquin returns as Rogue and tops her performance in the first. He character is now stronger and more developed. We also have Iceman in there who I think was played in a great performance by Shawn Ashmore.One more thing I loved; the writing. Most action movies are brought down by awful writing(i.e. Star Wars Episode 2) but this film was very well written. This movie showed a certain wit to it and had some great humor added into the lines. The movie was never rushed nor was it ever slow. I really liked Famke Janssen in this movie because her character, Jean Grey was also developed and her powers grew stronger. Storm, played by the beautiful Halle Berry, had more screen time and a bigger role in this installment and had a great relationship with Nightcrawler. Patrick Stewart was great in this one again and he also seemed a little more into his character in this movie.One more thing; the action and the special effects. Brilliant. This movie had more action than the first and great special effects. They all looked very real to me! All the characters that had action put a lot into their performances and looked like they actually had the powers their characters did. My two favorite battles were Lady Deathstrike v.s. Wolverine and the scene in Boston where Rogue(Marie), Bobby(Iceman), Logan(Wolverine), and John(Pyro), where Pyro started burning all the police cars. Those were my favorite scenes.Overall, this movie is the best so far and it does not disappoint.',\n",
              " 'Munich is getting extremely mixed reviews -- from a coronation by Roger Ebert to a trashing from Anthony Lane. My response is somewhere between the two. As a thriller, it is a little predictable for three hours, I accept that. Nevertheless, I\\'ve rarely shared a character\\'s (Bana\\'s character\\'s) sense of being hunted before in a movie. Yes, it\\'s a little heavy hitting on the sermonic/moralising side -- but it is Spielberg, and you expect a little didactic direction there. The last scene, with the appearance of the World Trade Center (it\\'s 1972) hammers the 9/11 commentary in a little too much for my liking. For minutes leading up to it, it was obvious that the two characters would end their dialogue with the twin towers in view. I was sitting in the theatre thinking, okay, pan a little more to the right, bring them in ... that\\'s it ... there you go! And then there\\'s the much discussed final sex scene between bana\\'s character and his wife. inter-cut with images of the Munich killings. I interpreted this to be a comment on the endless cycle of violeve: go forth and multiply, the biblical Israel is told, and with every new child is born another subject of generational hatred and the need for vengeance. Others have interpreted this scene more \"redemptively\" -- new life entering the world, the morning after the darkest night, etc. Overall, it\\'s a good, possibly important, film which misses some opportunities for subtlety and implied comment. Tony Kushner\\'s role seems to have been to polish -- and he had literally only weeks to do that. An original screenplay from Kushner would have improved this considerably. That\\'s not to give the movie a slating: i\\'d recommend it to anyone, and it has to be considered for some awards. The inevitable controversy in the U.S. about anti-semitism in the film is simply beyond stupid and beyond contempt.',\n",
              " '\"Scarface\" is a near-to-masterpiece, due to the amazing cast and the plot that makes you feel the tension and the excitement the film has to offer. Just like in other mafia classics, such as \"Goodfellas\", that tension, that overwhelms you while watching, releases and turns into joy and satisfaction while walking towards the exit in the theater hallway after the film ends.Al Pacino also plays a huge role, his performance is stunning and memorable. It is no doubt that is one of his best performances, because he is very involved and all his dedication and talent are shown in this role as Tony Montana. The film, of course, couldn\\'t be so thrilling without Michelle Pfeiffer\\'s Elvira Hancock. Her role is similar to Sharon Stone\\'s in Martin Scorsese\\'s \"Casino\"; a depressed, frustrated late-twenties/early-thirties married woman.Here\\'s only one thing to complain about \"Scarface\". Is Brian De Palma\\'s directing, which simply doesn\\'t deliver anything, but B-class movie material. De Palma might not be a bad director, he is actually talented and ambitious, but this time he didn\\'t do his best.All in all, this film should be watched, because, even though it is poorly directed, the cast, the plot and the script are great.',\n",

It\\'s a really interesting movie such as the plot and the storyline.I am thinking that at least one of the three protagonists of this movie (Eli Wallach, Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef) should have won an Oscar. I also think that maybe Sergio Leone should have won an Oscar for the direction and if not for this movie maybe for all the other good movies which has direct for example: For a few dollars more and A Fistful of Dollars.I like very much this movie because is a classic western movie with really good cast Clint Eastwood as The Good, Lee Van Cleef as The Bad and Eli Wallach as The Ugly.',\n",
              " '\"Sicario\" starts with a dramatic scene of police in action. At first, the viewer is ignorant of what is going down; then the story comes into focus and revelation after revelation changes the viewer\\'s understanding as the tension ratchets up.Kate Macer (Emily Blunt) is a seasoned FBI agent with experience in kidnapping cases and she is part of the team in that first action, as they invade a house where they believe hostages are being held. In the wake of that mission, she is given a chance to work with a task force with obscure authority. They promise her an opportunity to bring down those who were responsible for the deaths of two of her colleagues.As Kate enters the shadowy world of the War on Drugs, she is a witness, our surrogate, our eyes. The deeper the story goes, the more the operations feel outside authorized legal parameters. And Kate, who has always operated strictly within her authority, feels more nervous. Also on the task force is Alejandro (Benicio Del Toro), a quiet, inscrutable man who is intense. We eventually discover his background, his intentions, and his loyalties. That is the real story of \"Sicario\", though it is also about Kate\\'s journey and her education (and ours).It is tempting to write about the political ramifications of the film\\'s story, but that would reveal too much. I will only say that the prime movers in the shadowy world of \"Sicario\" are granted their powers by those who purport to despise them.Much of the film\\'s atmosphere, and its suspense, are the result of superior photography and a wonderfully moody score. The acting is--like the story and the scenery--sparse but elemental to the film\\'s tone. It is easy to see why \"Sicario\" is considered one of the best films of this year.',\n",

The performances were marvellous, the editing in a class of its own, the plot was solid and everything about the film was great. As a member of the crime-gangster sub-genre I found the film had a wonderfully human centre to it that Tarantino couldn't ever touch.Although it may not be to everyone's taste, I found the film amazing to watch (Every shot is artfully composed in a very European arthouse style), superb to listen to (David Holmes always has been a favourite musician of mine, and this film gave him a long-awaited chance to set his music to pictures), and generally brilliant. In 20 years time this film will be re-released and everyone will realise just how great it is.\",\n",
              " 'The rancher Daniel Evans (Christian Bale), who lost part of his leg in the Civil War, is broken and owing a large amount to a powerful man in Bisbee. When the outlaw Ben Wade (Russell Crowe) is captured after the heist of a stagecoach, Dan offers to escort the cold blood killer to the city of Contention to take the 3:10 PM train to Yuma to be sent to trial. In return, he would receive US$ 200,00, enough to save his land and give a better life to his family. During their journey, Ben gets closer to Dan while his gang of criminals follows the group to rescue their boss.The deceptive \"3:10 to Yuma\" has an absurd and incoherent plot and is absolutely overrated in IMDb. Indeed I can not understand how many viewers do not see how illogical this movie is (maybe influenced by the positive marketing). I am a big fan of Christian Bale, I like Russell Crowe a lot, and actually their performances are top-notch as usual. Regarding the Hollywoodian bad guy Ben Wade, he is a cold blood killer and leader of mean criminals. However, along their journey, he has feelings for Dan in a ridiculously corny situation; he runs and jumps over the roofs and alleys without any explanation to help Dan to reach the station; in the climax, he kills his own loyal men that had risked their lives to save him. Regarding Dan Evans, he leaves his wife and sons in a dangerous trip just to raise money; however, he neither accepts the offer of Ben (ok, it would be corruption and not compatible to a good guy) nor the money of the railroad agent when they are under siege in the hotel with a dreadful perspective of survival. Last but not the least, he runs and jumps very well with only one foot. Why the good guy did not kill the arrogant and cruel Ben Wade along the incidental trip? Maybe the most ridiculous situation is Byron McElroy (Peter Fonda), who was shot in the stomach, riding a horse on the next day. See the original 1957 film instead. My vote is five.Title (Brazil): \"Os Indom√°veis\" (\"The Indomitable\")',\n",
              " 'The one on one sniping movie left me bored and disinterested. In addition, the lack of an American forces the American viewer to choose a protagonist between two typically villainous countrymen; we must root for a German Nazi or a Russian. In light of not caring for either character, it was dull, and the love story was not developed much. All said I would NOT recommend this movie to anyone, even to someone who enjoys WWII films.

              " 'Director Steven Soderbergh, who is quickly becoming one of my favorite contemporary talents, has made over thirty films, some generating modest reception and others reaching high levels of praise. Traffic, by textbook definition, is probably his objective \"best,\" generating awards, controversy, discussion, shedding light on an issue, and most importantly, profit. All of its additional successes and trivia-points are well-deserved, as this is a truly compelling picture, unfairly shortchanged, presently, in the public eye. In a world where \"the war on drugs\" has escalated to unprecedented heights and profits are raging uncontrollably, this is a film that doesn\\'t age with time and shows more than what should\\'ve been allowed.To put it simply and bluntly, Traffic is a work of an anti-anthology, where we are introduced to a number of characters in similar situations, yet none of them ever come full-circle in a wraparound story. I will make an effort sum up the characters and their stories as quickly as possible, so as to leave much to be desired to you. For starters, Benicio Del Toro plays Javier Rodriguez, a Mexican police officer torn between which of the two Mexican drug cartels he runs to continue supporting. Should he fend for one and forget the other, or turn in his information to higher authorities and completely compromise the profits he gets to survive? Michael Douglas plays Robert Wakefield, a conservative politician attempting to combat \"the war on drugs\" as quickly as possible, at the same time he finds out his own daughter, Caroline (Erika Christensen), is a cocaine addict. Ranking in the top three in her Junior class at an exclusive private high school, Caroline resorts from hitting the books to feeding the habit, resorting to prostitution to support this lethal addiction. The final \"main\" story centers around Helena Ayala (Catherine Zeta-Jones), an upper-middle-class woman whose life is shell-shocked when her husband is arrested for drug dealing, she realizes, and must take up a life of being a drug mule to possibly save his well-being in prison.Another story that keeps popping up every now and then involves Ray and Montel (Luis Guzman and Don Cheadle), two undercover detectives usually working inside their van and staging drug-busts on suspects. Their work is dangerous, demanding, and often, meticulously staged and they wouldn\\'t have it any other way.Right off the bat, it\\'s hard not to recognize the amazing cast of champions Traffic serenely, but effectively boasts. If there\\'s a word for their performances all together, it\\'s nuanced, as they are not showy and none of them appear to be designed with awards in mind. Everyone here, most notably Douglas and Del Toro, although there\\'s not an average one in the bunch, are low-key and compelling, mainly due to their sympathetic nature. Even the most despicable acts done by characters, we at least have the ability to see where the characters are coming from.There are, undoubtedly, dozens of truths one can extract from Traffic in an effort to completely prove \"the war on drugs\" to be nonsense and almost wholly ineffective. The one truth I, myself, can extract with full confidence is a point brought up by Caroline, which is \"it\\'s easier for me and my friends to get drugs than alcohol.\" Because alcohol is legal, it\\'s regulated heavily, with a certain age to be able to consume it. When it comes to drugs, especially with many of the hardcore ones banned in America, they are sold illegally by men and women who do not care what age the person is or what their reason is for acquiring such drugs. So long as they get money and lose some supplies, they couldn\\'t care less what happens to them or what becomes of their habits.As of right now, this is Soderbergh\\'s most daring exercise. He boldly stands up to the narcotics controversy that has plagued American for an untold number of years, showing the effects of prohibition and how numerous lives have intentionally and unintentionally been effected by drugs. This is not a work of exploitation or shock, but of blunt honesty, showing how numerous different people are effected and thrown into turmoil by a huge problem that is almost too large to contain. In many ways, I believe the issue of drugs isn\\'t too far germane to the gun control issue. It seems people are bringing up flawed solutions to closet their views on the underlying, truly unavoidable result; the problem will likely never go away.On a final note, pay attention to the cinematography during the course of this film. The scenes in Mexico are heavily saturated, making the film have a yellowish glow to it, due to the sunshine and the gold sand. Often we can be blinded by the oppressive sunlight almost penetrating the camera lens through every shot, growing more and more fierce with every sequence. As a stylistic attribute, it\\'s a rather noteworthy one, and may have subtle ambiguous serendipity to the story. Could it be that the climate as an effect on their behavior? Or that the sun itself represents something larger, like a watching eye? Or maybe does it reflect the constantly glaring, incorruptible pressure of their job by showing the oppressive relentless of something. Like many instances in Traffic, Soderbergh leaves you to be the judge.Starring: Michael Douglas, Erika Christensen, Benicio Del Toro, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Dennis Quaid, Don Cheadle, Luis Guzman, Steven Bauer, and James Brolin, and Topher Grace. Directed by: Steven Soderbergh.',\n",

With finely polished performances from Pierce Brosnan and Rene Russo playing wonderfully against each other, they made this film work. Dennis Leary was equally impressive in his role as well. All of this combined with the New York City location filming made this movie a sure fire winner.On a scale of 1-10, I gave this one a well-deserved 9.

              " 'Most of the famous war films ever made, like \"Saving Private Ryan\" and \"Cross of Iron\", usually try to show the film and the war from the point of view of soldiers, those who fought in there. It is rare to see a film from the point of view of the innocent victims of the war. Probably the most famous film of victims is Steven Spielberg\\'s \"Schindler\\'s List\". Even rarer is an animated film of victims of war. Animations in western countries are usually labeled as children\\'s stuff, so it is no wonder Disney has refused to distribute this film, one of the Studio Ghibli\\'s greatest works.\"September 21, 1945 that was the night I died\"With those words starts director Isao Takahata\\'s most famous film, \"Grave of the Fireflies\" (Hotaru no haka, 1988). Unlike his long time friend and colleague Hayao Miyazaki, Takahata prefers to leave fantasy elements in his films to minimum. This is the way how Takahata amazes viewers. If Miyazaki\\'s fantastic visions make our jaws drop to floor with amazement, Takahata\\'s close to reality stories touch us deeply by hitting our emotions. And \"Grave of the Fireflies\" certainly does that masterly, being the only film that has ever managed to move me to the point of tears (and I am *not* a teary guy).The film, based on a novel by Akiyuki Nosaka, tells the story of a young boy named Seita, who with his little sister Setsuko, lives in the 1940\\'s Japan, during the World War II. After loosing their mother during a bombing, Seita does everything in his power to create an illusion for Setsuko that things are fine and there is nothing to worry about. The film has been often blamed of being too depressing and having a sad end, but I think it\\'s the opposite. Of course this certainly is not the kind of film to make you smile, but it is already revealed in the beginning that both brother and sister will die. So when we reach the end of the movie, with an image of them as spirits, sitting on a bench looking happy and healthy, with a modern day city around them, this is actually a happy ending after all the suffering they went through.It\\'s very hard to say exactly why this film should deserve full stars from me. It just does. It\\'s full of little beautiful scenes that instantly have an effect on you, accompanied by Michio Mamiya\\'s peaceful music. Maybe the fact that it can make me wonder why it is so good is the proof enough to make it a masterpiece. And that is what \"Grave of the Fireflies\" is; a masterpiece. One of the most amazing films from Studio Ghibli and Isao Takahata\\'s most famous film. And definitely the ultimate proof that animations can be used for other than children\\'s stories.',\n",
              " \"Where do I start. I've never written a review about any TV show or movie on IMDb before. But I really feel the need to review this one. The only reason I say that is because so many of the negative comments that I have seen on here about this show are incredibly misleading. People say it's a teeny drama show üòê. This is far from a teeny drama show. If you stick with it you'll see its very captivating. It's about war and sacrifice and tough decisions when it comes to the people you care about. I don't like when people spoil shows so I wont do that. What I will say though, is so many times people have to make decisions that are extremely hard. Honestly some decisions people might say are immoral. But because of the situation they're in its not easy to say. In that case it teaches you that things aren't black and white. The lines between right and wrong aren't always easy to see, especially in war. For science nerds saying it's unbelievable, it's science fiction just shut up and enjoy.\",\n",

              " \"Judge Dredd tells the story of human society in the near future, the entire world population has been crammed into a few 'Mega Cites' where millions of people live, outside the confines of these man made cities is what's now know as 'The Cursed Earth' our once green beautiful plant has become a hostile wasteland. Living inside these Mega Cities isn't easy & someone has to try & control the unruly locals, step in the likes of Judge Dredd (Sylvester Stallone) who have the power to try, convict & sentence. Dredd is feared throughout Mega City 1 as being very harsh & tough on criminals, that is why his brother Rico (Armand Assante) devises a plan to frame Dredd for murder, cause unrest & retaliation amongst the population & try to get a genetic cloning program called 'Janus' reopened by misguided Judge Grffin (Jurgen Prochnow) so he can use the technology for his own evil plans in an attempt to create a genetically cloned army of himself to help him gain complete control over Mega City 1, however Judge Dredd has other ideas...Directed by Danny Cannon I'm going to have to go against the general opinion here (as usual) & I'm going to say that I really rather enjoy Judge Dredd as a film & for that I apologise to no one. The script by William Wisher & Steven E. de Souza moves along at a nice pace, tells a decent enough story although it doesn't match the darkly clever comic book equivalent by any stretch of the imagination & generally speaking it entertains throughout. I liked the character's for what they were, Dredd is a tad clich√©d as he starts out tough but ends up showing some emotion while I quite liked the usually annoying Rob Schneider's comic relief character & Rico was an OK if somewhat unimaginative villain, I'd have loved to have seen Judge Death & his mates but I guess we can't always have what we want can we. The story lacks a certain political or satirical angle which it could have used to great effect, I must admit that I used to read the Judge Dredd comics when was younger & while I have't read any in donkey's years I have always remembered the story with Judge Death, no idea why I just have. Anyway, I can probably see why many dislike the somewhat standard American action film that the Judge Dredd name has been turned into here but when all said & done I thought it was a good watch & I enjoyed it & that's all that matters to me.Director Cannon does a good job, the special effects are still pretty good even now as they mix CGI, model work & live action. The whole look & feel is here, sure the helmets look a bit daft but otherwise the film hasn't dated badly at all & it still looks impressive. A special mention goes to the huge war robot who is totally cool. There is one part that I've never got, that's when Rico hatches the clone early & we see at last one sit up in it's pod but then they are never seen or referred to again, I suspect that more was filmed but ended up being cut out, a theory that would seem to be backed up by the IMDb's 'Alternate Versions' section. The film has a few violent moments & sufficient amount of action.Wit a supposed budget of about $90,000,000 Judge Dredd obviously has that Hollywood polish to it & is very well made with neat special effects that hold up even today. The acting was alright, Stallone makes for a good Dredd as he has to be virtually emotionless throughout.Judge Dredd seems to have a bad reputation which to an extent I can understand but I don't care about what anyone else thinks, I liked Judge Dredd for what it is & it's as simple & straight forward as that. Personally despite the lapse in logic at the end I think it's well worth a watch\",\n",

All the regulars return but this time the villain is Dr Octavious played by Alfred Molina. In my opinion however I thought Williem Dafoe was better as the villain. Everything was perfect, the scripting, the acting and the action sequences. For an superhero movie it is also quite emotional but that just adds to the appeal. There was also the hint of a revenge subplot between Harry Osborn and Spiderman. Spiderman 2 is the best in the franchise so far.I also went to see Spiderman 3 but to be honest I was slightly disappointed. That isn't enough to deter me from watching future sequels though.

But this remake of the original 1970s Amityville horror surpasses all its predecessors. I know that many people will disagree by saying ohhh its all special effects the acting crap and the story has been lost, but in my opinion the special effects are kept quite minimalist and the true tenseness is still there. there are lots of jumpy bits which really made me and my friend scream ( specially the werewolf creature in the barn oh my god scary stuff) but that aside the acting is fantastic the effects top the movie and the story if anything is a lot more scary then the original. if like me you love a good scream then watch this film you will not be disappointed.p.s. just had a thought what if they start to remake the other 7 amityville movies, oh no, i can see this heading down a black hole.',\n",
              " \"I absolutely hated this movie.Mild spoiler belowI have never seen so much shouting and screaming in my life. Every character is very, very serious and has to yell and scream and throw a mini-tantrum every scene. Watch the employee GET FIRED. Oh wait, let's hire him back. Oh let's FIRE the employee. Oh wait, let's hire him back. Oh let's FIRE the yaaawwwn.All the actors are very, very serious because you know how serious it is to produce a network TV show. Such mellodrama. They are acting like it is the ER and the president is getting shot.They every character has a rambling speech that goes on and on and on and on. Very serious stuff. You can tell because they have those lines in their foreheads when they speak.More yelling. More screaming. Life or death. About a news program for God's sake.There is has never been a film made with less subtlety. No subtlety at all. Just screaming, yetlling and overacting.Just horrendous, horrendous acting. How did it get all those Oscars? Because Hollywood loves movies about themselves. See Shakespeare in Love for example.It was pure agony to finish this movie. I had to break it up into four parts. I give it 2 stars because I wanted to see how they were going to end it. The whole seemed pointless.I have never disagreed with so many reviewers in my life. I suspect it is because a lot of people saw it back in the day. Old movies have a positive bias I noticed. Most don't hold up that well. I just saw Patton yesterday and I give that a 10. This one does not stand the test of time. By the way, I was 9 when this was released so I am old too.My overwhelming emotion in watching this movie is I wanted to tell all these actors and actresses to sit down and shut the hell up.\",\n",
              " \"The 400 Blow Is the first film Iv'e seen from Fran√ßois Truffaut, and Is a quintessential piece of cinema from the French new wave. It tells the story of a rebellious young boy called Antoine. Throughout the film Antoine Is struggling to find his place In the world. His home life Is dysfunctional, he's disenfranchised with his school life and his teachers don't understand him. He's un-loved by his parents, especially by his un-caring mother, who didn't want him the first place. He's constantly skipping school and lying to his teachers and parents. After numerous Instances causing trouble, he steals a type writer from his step-fathers workplace, which proves to be the final straw. He winds up In a juvenile detention facility, where he doesn't fare any better.Watching this film I was constantly reminded of Tony Richardson's The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner. Which came out a couple of years after this film, and was clearly Inspired by It. It's clear to see the Influence this film has had on Cinema. It's a wonderful piece of work, despite this being Truffaut's debut, he crafts a highly accomplished film. The technical side of this film such-as the lighting and direction are expertly handled. The film also contains a wonderful screenplay, there's not a single dull moment In the film, every scene feels Important and necessary. Truffaut takes his time to flesh out every character In film. Every character feels like a fully formed three dimensional human being, In-which they're filled with regret and flaws. The film shows the angst and harsh reality of growing up and feeling un- wanted and disconnected.\",\n",

However, if you have just come from work and want to relax by potatoing on the couch, watching three sexy gals have a very improbable time of their lives, wearing uncomfortable but sexy clothing, which probably explains the very bad stunting, this is the movie! Cameron gets to be her goofy self, Drew get to scream, sometimes very unnecessarily, and Lucy gets to be just hot and really smart. I love her in this movie.',\n",
              " \"After watching this movie (twice, now), a certain Firefly quote has been ringing in my ears -Simon Tam: How do I know you wouldn't kill me in my sleep?\\nMalcolm Reynolds: If I wanted to kill you, you would be awake, you'd be armed and facing me.Luke Skywalker, the Jedi who redeemed Vader, who threw away his weapon when facing Darth Vader and the Emperor, would never think of igniting his lightsaber while his worst enemy is asleep, let alone Ben Solo, his disciple and nephew, child of his beloved sister and friend, who could never have entered the Dark Side as deep as Vader did, at least the movie never went out of its way to try to make us believe it.I am a very tolerant fan, ready to enjoy anything they give us. But what Luke did, I can't find a way to justify. Apart from my own family, Luke is the one I loved longest in my life, I am not ready to despise him. Judging from the relatively nice ending Rian Johnson gave Luke, he does not intend to disgrace him. I think Rian Johnson respects Luke as I do. It's just that they were not able to come up with a plausible reason why Luke went into hiding. I never had my hopes high enough to expect them to. But I never thought they would do it so wrong.Apart from Luke, they did not make good decisions with other characters either. Poe in TFA was an eligible team leader, but he behaved worse than Ezra Bridger in his decisions in the Last Jedi. If he fails and learns something from his failure, it would be called character progression. But no, we don't see him reflecting on any of his mistakes, instead, we see Leia and Holdo exchange praise for him. Oscar Isaac is a powerful actor. To make Oscar Isaac so annoying indeed says something about the script.The Emperor in the OT was not a very full character, but his death was the rebirth of Anakin, and also showed Luke's power in the light side of the force. The Emperor was a sufficient symbol of evil in the mythology (not to mention the added depth in the prequels and in the Clone Wars). However, Snoke's death feels so unsatisfying. What did he do to Kylo Ren? What about his scars and disfigurement? How did he come to command the First Order? We haven't really known Snoke, and his death does not signify anything. This could probably be redeemed with later storytelling. Maybe it signifies Kylo Ren's point of no return to the dark side? But he seems to be on a redemption arc because Rey's agenda for the better part of this movie was to try to redeem him. You could also argue that Rey shut out Kylo in the end of this movie. But who knows? This movie does not seem to have a resolution. Empire Strikes Back ended on Luke knowing the truth, Attack of the Clones ended on the beginning of a war. Being the middle of a trilogy does not mean it can have no resolution.I think Rose and Vice Admiral Holdo are great characters. But I'm in no mood to like them when old favorites are butchered so pointlessly.I also disagree on that Luke explicitly calling the Jedi a religion. In TFA Lor San Tekka could be said to belong to a religion that believe in the Force. But such a term from our world feels so restrictive when applied on the core mythology of Star Wars. I understand we old fans should not act snobbish and think what we think is the right interpretation. But I truly think this is an unwise choice. If a casual movie goer says so I wouldn't mind.Rey's turn from anger to empathy with Kylo would be hard to believe had it not been Daisy Ridley's earnest performance. Adam Driver is phenomenal. I am very disposed to love Mark Hamill. All the cast is great. The pace of the movie is a little bit dreary at times but overall good. I appreciate their intention to give Luke a peaceful and purposeful ending. However all of these cannot cover the blatant bad decisions mentioned above.Farewell, Luke Skywalker. I wish The Last Jedi didn't exist so that I can continue projecting my best wisdom on you and be inspired by you.\",\n",

This movie keeps you busy with the slapstick comedy of hitting people with wrenches, but blows itself out of the water with social commentary and intellectual jokes. If you see only one film this summer that involves Ben Stiller hitting someone in the balls with a Dodgeball, make it this one.Spoiler: the great part about the intellectual jokes in this film, is that i know I didn\\'t get all of them, when I see this movie again, I know I\\'ll laugh just as hard at all the new jokes I find; for example: the first time I watched it I was laughing too hard at the German team being called Team Blitzkrieg, that I didn\\'t even hear the announcer say, \"here come to Germans, appeasement be damned!\".

              " '25 years ago, action movies were redefined when a lone cop faced terrorists controlling a building in \"Die Hard\". Huge success, and it was followed by three more: in 1990, facing another terrorists on an airport; in 1995, while saving New York, echoing the first episode in style and one plot device and in 2007 saving the United States from a powerful hacker. We heard the rumors of a fifth part several times, but some of us were very skeptic, I mean, the sequel would be in Russia and that didn\\'t look alright for some odd reason. To celebrate those 25 years we love the amazing John McClane, this huge hero which presented Bruce Willis to a mainstream cinema audience after years of success on TV, we have those movies and now...this movie. Ugh the feels... Why? Compared to the others, it\\'s a epic failure that diminishes McClane/Willis greatness and seems focused in giving a new face to the franchise, McClane\\'s estranged son, played by a hunky yet expressionless Jai Courtney. Their mission: to protect an important Russian criminal about to testify on court and also to solve some family matters once and for all.Light years from being part of the franchise, this is more like a sequel to \"The Cold Light of Day\" with some small changes. Deceiving? Totally. It doesn\\'t look like \"Die Hard\", it looks like old version of McClane getting involved in nasty fights and long chases; the plot is so easy and so uncompromising that hurts. But this is less deceiving than what the viewers make this look like. It\\'s not a bad film, has its moments and it\\'s quite good. Purely entertaining. The intelligence, the amazement, the excitement, all the things that makes a great \"Die Hard\" movie is absent here, or so few that doesn\\'t last in the memory. It\\'s always fun to see Willis in action after all these years, see how McClane shifts through the decades and the way he acts while getting a piece of the action. In \"A Good Die to Hard\" he\\'s quite light, exceeding in humor and still knowing how to chase bad guys, fight them and escape from the most incredible situations. Dealing with his son is a bummer but the partnership they form against the criminals is good - but nothing awesome like McClane and Zeus Carver. The most saddening fact about this is that we don\\'t have a megalomaniac and terrifying villain as antagonists like Hans and Simon Gruber, or even Colonel Stewart and Thomas Gabriel, or that chick from the 4th film. The villains are also part of the reason why \"Die Hard\" is hallucinating and cool to watch, and here they\\'re reduced to some hit men with machine guns and one plot twist (best part of this) that is somewhat predictable. But let\\'s face it! Die Hard\\'s can only be directed by John McTiernan (1st and 3rd films), as an R rated movie, two hours of pure adrenaline, some humor and lots of unimaginable action sequels that leaves us breathless and wanting for more. Renny Harlin was OK, but slowed down \"Die Hard 2\" in a way that sometimes it\\'s unbearable to watch it; and Len Wiseman made such a softer \"Die Hard\" that many hate it (there\\'s even a nickname for it, DHINO, I didn\\'t know that until a few days ago) just like they\\'re hating this one. Not his fault, blame it on Fox\\'s for wanting more audience. And now John Moore makes his turn and...not good enough. We can all agree this is the expendable flick from the series, hands down. Damn shame Mr. McTiernan is in jail - if you don\\'t know the story google it or just check his bio in this present site - otherwise he would be directing a great follow up from two of his greatest hits. He has the magic touch for conducting those.To quote the power quote from this episode \"I\\'m on vacation!\". It sure looks like Hollywood and the writers of this were, indeed, on vacation and decided that the automatic pilot should direct this thing. I know it\\'s not their mission to bring something original or to redefine the action genre as we know it, that would be impossible. However, they should at least try to convince us that we are watching another part of one of the most amazing franchises of all time. Neither that they could make it happen. Watch it like an ordinary film and you\\'ll get something out of this, a few minutes of some mindless entertainment. 6/10',\n",
              " 'David Morris (Matt Damon) is running for office in New York. After a shocking photo is revealed to the press, David realizes that his dream of taking office as New York\\'s next Governor isn\\'t going to happen. While prepping for his last big speech to congratulate the winner of the election, he runs into a woman named Elise (Emily Blunt) who changes everything. Elise makes David feel something that he has never felt before and changes his whole outlook on life. This is when the Adjustment Bureau steps in to make sure that Elise and David never cross paths again. An interesting film about destiny ensues...I have been seeing advertisements for \"The Adjustment Bureau\" for what seems like over a year now. The film was originally slated to be released in 2010 but the film went through some re-edits including some alterations with the ending. Needless to say, I was really worried when it was pushed back for so long. Normally in Hollywood, when a movie gets its release date moved so much, its a bad sign. I am happy to report, however, that the film is actually pretty solid and lives up to it\\'s solid marketing campaign.Emily Blunt and Matt Damon are the stars of the film and the two of them work great together. They have solid on-screen chemistry and seem like they really enjoyed working with one another. Damon\\'s character David seemed like President Obama when he was running for office. Damon is skilled at playing characters like the one he played here. He plays the smart yet action packed role perfectly and has done so in several other films. Emily Blunt is great in the film as well. I enjoyed her humor and she has solid on screen presence. Her character is fun yet intelligent, which really made Elise such a likable character. She just felt real, like someone who you would meet in real life.The other supporting actors were terrific as well. There are so many smaller roles in this film that I probably won\\'t name them all but will focus on a few of the main ones. Anthony Mackie who played agent Mitchel, played a really solid character. It was interesting seeing him go through the emotions and fighting the idea of whether or not he should help David. John Slattery and Terence Stamp who also played agents in the film did a good job trying to warn David about adjusting his future. These supporting stars all helped to build the suspense in the film.The best thing about \"The Adjustment Bureau\" is probably the story, which oddly enough is also it\\'s biggest flaw. The idea of an organization that controls our faith and destiny is an interesting one. The film makes its audience wonder about the events that occur on a regular basis in ones life and asks the question was it part of a bigger plan or was it destiny? That idea alone is what makes this film interesting from start to finish. The audience is always trying to unravel the mystery behind what\\'s going to happen next. We want to know how and why this organization is controlling the faith of David and Elise.With that being said, the movie\\'s idea is great but the script leaves the audience wanting more. Its one of those movies where the idea is intriguing but requires its audience to shut off their thinking caps. I will begin explaining this with the simple fact that David is running for major office, yet he is never surrounded by body guards or security. That seems odd from the get go. Then this organization gets introduced and why they pick him isn\\'t really flesh out. Then the idea of going through doors isn\\'t really discussed with enough detail either. The ending, while I did enough it, left me wanting more. I just felt that the story\\'s premise was a great one especially for a film but it just wasn\\'t intelligently executed. The story was more for the non-thinkers and I guess for a Hollywood type film, I shouldn\\'t knock it because at least it was a creative story.In closing, I ready did enjoy \"The Adjustment Bureau\" and thought it was a solid flick. The story will really grab the audience\\'s attention and the performances by Blunt and Damon will have you at the edge of your seat and rooting for them at the same time. Some may argue that the end result was one that was too clich√©d but I think in terms of the story here, it really made sense. I think even in life as much as we don\\'t want to admit it, all we really want is companionship and the film really goes the distance to rely that message. Sure, it should have spent a little less time with that message and more about the bureau itself and I will not try to deny that. This film could have been a masterpiece if the storyline was better explained. I realize most people don\\'t like thinking when they see a movie but I think nowadays with film\\'s like \"Inception\" making big bucks, I think a few movies a year that challenge its audience really would be great. \"The Adjustment Bureau\" had the potential of being that type of film but instead it took the turn off your brain route instead. At the end of the day, it was a good flick with some flaws but I really did enjoy it from start to finish even though I had to turn off my brain to do so!MovieManMenzel\\'s final rating for \"The Adjustment Bureau\" was a 7 out of 10.',\n",
              " \"The future, robots, and the unimaginable always fascinate me.This film is exciting to watch, and the logic is quite reasonable. However, the gadgets that they used in the film are not very futuristic. For example, they are still using cell phones, and office settings are still very much like the 20th century. Some of the city traffic scenes are well done. Nevertheless, we have seen plenty of those in many previous movies.I was a little disappointed that they actually used a real actor for the robot Sunny. Of course, this is still the year of 2004. I don't expect a real robot actor. They could have used a computer-generated robot through out the movie, and then it might be too expensive. In the ending, when they had to destroy the mainframe computer, it looks as if they just combined scenes from <<Star Wars>> and <<2001>>. Same concept, almost same scene.\",\n",

The movie treats the viewers as intelligent people. It is not in the same league of a plethora of science fiction movies that hit the cinemas every year. For example this year we have Independence Day 2, a high budget sequel to a high budget b-movie from a long time ago. It is profoundly forgettable. That is in stark contrast to Edge of Tomorrow, which has stayed with me for so long and today motivated me to come here on IMDb to write a review after two years!This movie is a must watch.

              " 'This was already the third or forth time I watched Disney\\'s Frozen and this is especially impressive as this film was released only slightly over 2 years ago. In my opinion, these 100 minutes prove that Disney is still on par with Pixar, even if you have to keep in mind that the likes of Lasseter worked on this film as well. Chris Buck and Jennifer Lee adapted this famous Hans Christian Andersen tale and also directed the film. Very deserving Academy Award winner for Best Animated Feature and I am also happy about Kristen Anderson and Robert Lopez winning for the magnificent \"Let It Go\", even if I liked the Golden Globe winning song from U2 too. Back to the film, it is a great story on sisterhood, about finding the right person for you, but most of all this film is worth watching for the great humor and outstanding looks. The snow world is so beautiful, there are many visually stunning scenes. In terms of the comedy, there is hardly a minute, during which you will not be entertained. This film put a smile on my lips so so many times, be it Kristoff singing for his moose, Olaf (everything about him, especially \"I have no bones\", so awkwardly funny).I have to say I am not a great fan of Kristen Bell and she is probably the most prominent cast member. But here she is fine, just like all the other voice actors. The story, of course, helps them a lot. Some real movie magic in here, several unexpected plot developments will have you glued to the screen. The good thing is it is never stupid or unrealistic. It all works well in my opinion. The drama is as good as the comedy. And it is a truly heartfelt film. Apart from the previously-mentioned \"Let It Go\", there are a handful other wonderful songs in here. I will not list the titles because you can check them in the list of songs, or even better watch the movie (again), but they were all extremely catchy. No exceptions.All in all, as you obviously know by now, I really dig this film. Certainly a contender for best 2013 movie for me and it is not getting any worse on rewatch either. If you like it as much as I do, make sure to check out the short film that followed not too long ago, even if it was nowhere near as great as the full feature film. I wonder if they will ever make a sequel to this one. The great reception from audiences, critics and awards bodies makes me thing that it could be very possible. However, they really need to make sure to come up with something new and creative that makes sense in the grand scheme of things, taking the first film into consideration. If they succeed to do so, I am not scared at all of a sequel, but looking forward to it a lot. Anyway, how can you doubt Disney and Pixar these days. Basically all their new films are winners right now. Just like this one. Highly, highly recommended, if you are one of the 2 people who have not seen this film yet. \"Animation is for kids\" is not only not an invalid excuse, it is also not true at all. Your loss then I guess, so go check it out. You will not regret it.',\n",

Then the viewer finds out that Ego is a mad celestial and his plan is to capture the world. But Guardians stop his and save the Galaxy again. Now, characters. Peter Quill (the main character) is the captain of Guardians, he called himself Star Lord and he's the most charismatic member of the team. Gamora is a woman with green skin and perfect sword fighting skill. Drax is a good warrior and a brave alien. Rocket and Baby Groot are the smallest members of Guardians, but don't underestimate them. Also we can see Ego (an ancient crazy alien) and Yondu Udonta which educate Peter and replace him father; however, Quill understand it when Yondu sacrificed himself for the sake of Peter's salvation. Guardians of the Galaxy based on comics (as well as all films of Marvel Studio). I think, the producer made many fans happy. This movie has very vivid special effects and great film score. But personally I feel that I can't give 10 out of 10 to the film, despite all the advantages. The reasons of it are firstly weak plot of Guardians and secondly film's focus on the children's audience. Finally, Guardians of the Galaxy is a good action film, but I wouldn't watch it again.\",\n",

They begin to attack Chappie even though he has done no wrong to them. This scene captures the whole humans are afraid of the unknown and different. But this movie has a lot wrong with it as well.

What I thought was going to be a supernatural thriller, the way it started, turns out to be a silly sci-fi horror almost as bad as the Stephen King adaptation of 'Sleepwalkers', just to name one.May be it is very hard to make a good Stephen King adaptation when it involves creatures not from this earth, or in a different time, or et cetera. 'The Langoliers' is another great example of something that starts very interesting and once those monsters appear becomes something stupid. There it took a while for them to appear, here we are only at a quarter of the movie.The interesting supernatural part I was talking about involves the four friends Henry, Beaver, Jonesy and Pete. As kids they meet the mentally retarded Duddits, who seems to have supernatural powers and passes some of them to the four friends. As adults (they are played by Thomas Jane, Jason Lee, Damian Lewis and Timothy Olyphant) they still have the powers and that is where the movie begins. They have telepathic gifts; they know things from strangers and are able to have contact with each other without speaking, and this is demonstrated with the great opening scenes.When the four friends go to the woods for some hunting things go wrong. With them, and the movie. I will not tell you what happens exactly because you can guess by then. The movie never gets scary or interesting after the opening scenes again. For me the only thing I could enjoy from there was snow falling from the sky and performances that were alright. With two hours and ten minutes the movie is way too long and with a something this stupid and predictable you can only waste your time. Read the book and make your own version instead.\",\n",
              " 'Believable. Go into this film with an open mind and you\\'ll enjoy every minute of it. Is it the greatest movie of all time? No. Is it one of the best vampire movies ever put to the screen? I say \"Yes!\".\\nWhat makes this film refreshing is the perspective of the story. You may not realize while watching, but there is very little \"human\" involvement in the story. Because of this, the characters involved become more \"human\" and their story becomes more believable.Particularly believable is the embedded explanation of how vampires and werewolfs came to exist. Backing the modern era conflict with those historical facts is important to the plot; it is the foundation on which the story is built.Another huge aspect of the film that leads to believability is that the characters are free to express emotions. Vampires that cry, werewolfs that grieve -- anger, vengence, love, integrity, all contribute to making the \"monsters\" more \"human\".C\\'mon, to say Kate Beckinsale is \"hot\" in this film is an insult. Kate is absolutely sizzling! The role of Selene is so contradictory to anything that Kate has done thus far. The fact that this was not a stereotypical role for her, made Selene a flawless character.Twists in the storyline will keep you intellectually challenged. What you believe at the start, you will challenge yourself to believe midway through -- your attachment to the character Lucian will prove this to be true.\\nDon\\'t get hung up on spoilers. So vampires aren\\'t supposed to be able to cast a reflection. Says who? Humans? Well humans didn\\'t know there was an unground battle raging between to non-existent species for centuries. The casting of a reflection (Selene in the mirror) is important to the story. For you hardcore vampire enthusiasts, let the story challenge your beliefs and accept that perhaps things are not as you have come to believe.\\nLet it go and enjoy the film for what it is -- a high impact, action filled, Romeo and Juliet-ish, Matrix-like, portrayal of humanity from a non-human perspective.',\n",
              " \"Crimson Peak is the much anticipated, brand new film by acclaimed visual director Guillermo del Toro. This is del Toro's English- language ode to his previous Spanish films: The Devil's Backbone and Pan's Labyrinth. The movie stars Mia Wasikowska as Edith Cushing, an aspiring writer in late 19th century Buffalo. She becomes enamored by Tom Hiddleston's Sir Thomas Sharpe, who is accompanied by his sister Lucille Sharpe brilliantly played by Jessica Chastain. Now the first to thing to realize is that Crimson Peak is not your typical horror film. It's exactly what del Toro had said during promotions that this movie was a Gothic romance and not necessarily a horror movie. But, that's not to say that there aren't a few scares here and there. They are mostly prevalent with the ghosts in the middle of the film, but even then, the scares are quite predictable and for hardcore horror fans, they will be nothing. However, the sequence at the end of the movie (for about 20 minutes) is fantastically gory and has been described by many as a tribute to hammer horror. If Crimson Peak would've actually explored more with that side of its film personality, this movie could've qualified more as a horror than anything else frankly. But that's not to say that the Gothic romance of the movie is bad or underwhelms. There is a certain sense, especially when you meet Lucille, but even with Thomas Sharpe that he may be an odd character even though he is this charming Brit seemingly just in America for a business opportunity. And when Thomas first meets Edith, there does seem to be a legitimate connection between the two characters. The movie is at its peak in terms of its characters especially with the portrayal of the Sharpe siblings. Jessica Chastain channels her inner demonic being in portraying Lucille, while Thomas is the smooth and suave Brit who is the charmer but you can tell that there is some sort of cynicism behind his character. The character of Edith on the other hand is just used as a plot device, where her character is what is allowing the progression of the story and no further. She does make significant contribution once the action begins towards the end, but until then it's a lot of interactions with ghosts who tell her to take heed of Crimson Peak (but of course, she doesn't). However, if there is one thing that Crimson Peak cannot be faulted on, is its style and surroundings. It will be the movie that gives The Man from U.N.C.L.E. a run for its money in terms of costume design at the Oscars. The costumes are absolutely brilliant and really do show off the period nature of the movie. The movie is also brilliantly shot with a very late 19th-century color pallet to start the movie and once the film moves to Allerdale Hall, the construct of the house itself really makes it apparent of the creepiness of Crimson Peak. All in all, Crimson Peak is a great attempt for del Toro in his first English language film that is similar to his previous work in Spanish. But it's not his best; that title would still belong to Pan's Labyrinth with The Devil's Backbone closely behind. There is definitely more style over substance but it shouldn't detract from the fact that del Toro has made a movie that wants me yearning for more of his work.Crimson Peak gets a grade of B-.

              " 'This is terrible film - without any meaning. Uncomplete and unfinished scenarios and actions during the film. Lot of not natural voices and blood. The main creators of this low-quality film are suffering with inferiority complex (this is my subjective sentiment). After watching this \"film\" i have some questions and advices to above-mentioned persons (team). 1. What is the aim of this film? 2. Have you ever seen in the real life such animals, who can kill without any reason? I think - no. It is impossible. 3. Why you are making such a disgusting films? There are lot of beautiful things and moments in the life that can be shown in the works of art . . .',\n",
              " \"Barney the Dinosaur is more entertaining than this movie. yeah sure, when he cracks one or two jokes, its funny, but my gosh he would go on and on ! Regarding the sexual scenes of the movie, if one wants to watch porn, they'd watch porn. I don't know which woman enjoys a man that talks from beginning to end ? Even during sex he is cracking lame jokes. Cant get any more ridiculous than that ! As for the storyline , couldn't they add a little more detail. Its like they thought making him blabber throughout the movie will allow them to cut some finer details out. One of the worst movies ever made in the last century !\",\n",
              " \"This is an amazing film which kept me gripped from start to finish. I suppose the backlash from the critics was expected, I remember the same thing happening to Gladiator. Critics don't warm to epics made after the 1980's. Well I have little respect for them anyway. This movie is gripping from start to finish and I have the upmost respect for Brad Pitt who gives a powerhouse of a perfomance. A Lot of credit goes out to Wolfgang Peterson. This film is action non stop and exhilarating viewing. The action is breathtaking and I believe the battle scenes top even the Lord of the Rings trilogys. There is also tremendous support from Eric Bana, Peter O'Toole and Sean Bean. Strongest of recommendations.\",\n",
              " 'Just to clarify one thing: I don\\'t hate Tim Burton at all. In fact, I kinda love his work. He has a very unique and imaginative vision, seems to have a tasteful choice for actors (besides Johnny Depp as the Mad Hatter), and can really pour his heart and soul in some of his films like \"Edward Scissorhands\", \"Corpse Bride\", and \"The Nightmare Before Christmas\". But, just like any director, he has his missteps also. Some of his recent work is very lackluster and, at times, flat-out bad (Planet of the... BLAHK!).But I was still excited for this particular project of his. I haven\\'t read the book, or knew much about it, but when I saw the trailer I got my hopes up. Maybe this will be his big comeback! Asa Butterfield is an actor I like, the imagery is appropriately dream- like and the source material seems to fit his style perfectly. It even has the screenwriter from X-Men: First Class!So I went to see the film with a few of my friends in a theater of around 15 people and 25-30 recliner seats. I couldn\\'t wait to see another great Tim Burton movie!And for the first half of the film... I genuinely enjoyed it! Sure, it does take some time for Jacob to reach Peregrine\\'s home, but once he does... I couldn\\'t help but smile like an idiot. The world that Jacob enters is fascinating, the visuals are exceptional, and every one of the peculiar kids are very interesting side- characters. I wanted to learn more about the girl that could lift boulders over her head! There is also this kid that can project his dreams into film... how cool! The first act always left me with questions that I was excited to hear about when the plot kicks in.And then the plot kicks in...That is where the movie starts to run out of steam.I could tell there were a lot of story elements in the book just from watching the movie, because in the second half a lot of it felt crammed in. Whenever I try to follow the story as best as I can, there\\'s always this one subplot that makes precious little sense. It also doesn\\'t help that the villain is weak and his motivations are somewhat vague.The climax is pretty abrupt and Burton sadly delves into a few clich√©s that aggravate me. A lot of it felt by-the-numbers at that time, and I was sorely disappointed.That\\'s not to say that this was a bad film, because it isn\\'t. The acting (especially from Eva Green) is competent, the whole film is imaginative in its story and visuals, and somewhere buried beneath lies a great film with lots of creative ideas and appealing whimsy. But the plot is messy, the main character is bland, the pacing is at times uneven and, in the end, it\\'s just another average YA adaptation that had loads of potential.VERDICT:+ Visuals + Well-cast, especially for Eva Green + Imaginative + Sense of wonder in the first act + Solid directing + Interesting side charactersVillain - The hero is underdeveloped - Plot is messy - Pacing is uneven - Unconvincing love chemistrySCORE: 5.5/10',\n",
              " '\"I\\'ve been thinking about it for the last 20 years.\" I had no idea that this was a remake/revision or restyling of a Korean cult movie from 2003. When I read the opinions quickly, all the art-loving movie audiences are outraged and say it\\'s a useless, failed, and terribly bad version of the original movie. May well be, but then again I have the advantage that I\\'ve never seen that Korean version, and probably never will see it. I don\\'t like Asian movies that much. Mostly they are technical abominable looking creations with terribly nervous little Asians who are running around all the time. And there is the insurmountable language gap so I am obliged to look at the subtitle all the time. I\\'ve already tried to watch an Asian film and notice that I always end up with a sore thumb because I\\'m pressing all the time the rewind button.And besides, the original movie by Chan-Wook Park is actually a movie version of a famous Japanese manga. In fact, Spike Lee\\'s version is also a reinterpretation of the same comic. Eventually, this \"Oldboy\" turns out to be an outright duplicate of the Korean version. There are some explicit scenes left out and apparently the denouement got a slightly different interpretation. Besides, I don\\'t understand why you would watch this remake when you think that the original is so divine and matchless impressive. I have the same issue with the Swedish film \"M√§n som hatar kvinnor\" which I think is sublime. I don\\'t think I\\'ll ever watch the U.S. version \"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\", because I foresee that I won\\'t approve of it. Is it possible that if you watched the U.S. version of \"Oldboy\" before the supposed masterpiece from Park, the result could be that perhaps you would appreciate both ? Seems to me that it\\'s a foregone conclusion that this movie wouldn\\'t do justice to Park\\'s version. What if the U.S. version would be directed by Steven Spielberg with Will Smith starring in it (seems that was the initial plan) ? Would that be okay ? Scheiss Egal ! Ignorant, unbiased and as neutral as someone from Switzerland I started watching. Josh Brolin is Joe Doucett, a divorced alcoholic who lives in a self-destructive way. He\\'s a representative who must close a deal successfully. But his obnoxious, drunken behavior ruins it all and he ends up in the gutter. Eventually he wakes up trapped in a cell that has the appearance of a hotel room and discovers that he\\'s accused of the murder of his ex-wife. He\\'s eventually imprisoned for a very long period without awareness of the reason. As time goes by, he overcomes his alcohol addiction and he trains his mind and body to attempt an escape. Twenty years later, he\\'s suddenly released and he plans to find the responsible who has done this to him and take revenge I admit that the build up was pretty confusing and I repeatedly had the tendency to turn it off. The reasonable long period of his incarceration made it look like an art-house film with the metamorphosis of a person in captivity shown painfully slow. The claustrophobic images, anger, helplessness, sorrow, rehab, the sometimes frenzied and insane behavior with images that were shown in different positions and perspectives, weren\\'t signs that this would be an exciting and action-packed movie. But after this section a lurid and insane put together story began that eventually degenerated into a kind of Oedipus tragedy. Shortly after his release, Joe eliminated an American Football team in a highly effective and cold-blooded brutal way. What started was a \"Quentin Tarantino\"-like spectacle , with no-nonsense explicit violence. The fight scene in the corridors with a large gang was extremely meticulous imaged with a smart choreography . I re-winded it three times purely for pleasure and because it was fun. Sure it felt like a revived Bud Spencer movie , but that made it more fun to watch it all. I actually grinned and laughed about it.Josh Brolin was perfectly picked out for this role. The drunk marginal figure that turned into a bloodthirsty Kill Bill in 20 years, was played in a convincing way. The final denouement where he comes to realize how the fully developed plan was put together and where he made the decision to give up his freedom, was masterfully and convincingly mapped. Samuel L. Jackson was also perfect as the sadistic business manager of the obscure little hotel. However, Copley didn\\'t impress me as the ailing Chucky.The only not so realistic thing I could think of in this ingenious and surprisingly put together story, was the fact that he mastered a martial art in 20 years. Agreed, he had time enough for it, but I don\\'t think you can learn these fighting techniques by just watching a television broadcasts.Conclusion: a lurid, bloody and sometimes excessive revenge movie with a perverse denouement (a remark made by my wife) with an impressive Brolin in the leading role. For those who think that Park\\'s movie is unmatchable: cherish it whatsoever. Perhaps a Park adept would look at this one in a different way if he hadn\\'t seen Park\\'s version (as mentioned before). For me it was an original and unusual movie.',\n",

              " \"This is my first review of a movie, so hopefully it won't be too bad...First of all I'd like to address the positives of the movie. Anyone who loves cars will definitely love this movie, but that doesn't stop the non-car fanatics enjoy the movie as well. Myself being the latter, thoroughly enjoyed the movie. The cars were spectacular and I was in awe at how they all looked, especially Twinkie's Hulkmobile! The stunt-people did an amazing job and the same with the production crew. All the aesthetics were amazing and left me with what I can only describe as a feeling of awe. The storyline was the only thing that disappointed me, but it didn't detract from the overall feeling of the movie too much, the story wasn't what this movie was about, it was about fast cars, plain and simple. I think that if there was more of a story it would have started to draw attention away from the cars, which I reinforce, was the main appeal of the movie. All of the actors and actresses also did a fine job, when times got tough you could feel it, when times got awkward you could feel it, when times got sad... you could feel it. Everything else about the movie was spectacular, and is definitely one that I will watch over and over again in weeks to come.\",\n",
              " \"Another example of a fantastic idea ruined by the execution. That's one of the most annoying things about Doug Liman's movies - his movies have this great concept at the core, but more often than not, these concepts and ideas are direly under-cooked or muddled. For me, the teleportation aspect was sorely under-used and under-explored. What's even worse is the idea that a secret society of Paladins are out to hunt down these teleporters because they are abominations to God. So far, so clich√©d! More time could've been spent on the Paladins, explaining a little more about their background and mandate, but instead, they were more like a side-note or afterthought just so Hayden Christensen has baddies to fight. Oh, that brings me to the leads - Christensen has to be one of the worse actors ever, he's not so much as wooden as leaden! Possibly worst choice ever to play a guy who's conflicted about his powers, leaving his father all alone and having a mother who's a Paladin. For some reason, I just don't like Rachel Bilson, it may just be her character in this movie, but she was irritating, which has caused me to avoid all of Bilson's other movies. Jamie Bell was brilliant though, unashamed of his powers, but street-wise enough to avoid Paladin detection, you can tell he had fun playing his role. In the end, Liman's direction (or lack thereof) and the two main leads has teleported all fun from what could've been a really good movie.\",\n",
              " 'How people can rate 7.9 this boring and empty movie? Action is zero. Style is very very old. Clooney acts like a dog. Script is not original at all.

              " \"I have not watched many romantic comedies and am not a huge fan of them, however I quite enjoyed the film and have given it an 8 out of 10.The plot line is quite enjoyable especially in line with the characters portrayed. The chemistry between the two lead parts (Tom - Patrick Dempsey and Hannah - Michelle Monaghan) is near perfect in the film giving an enticing feel to the story. Even if you are not a fan of this genre as am I, I would still recommend this film due to many funny scenes and moments, lots of enjoyable and funny dialogue between Patrick Dempsey and Michelle Monaghan, plus the Character Tom is a confident, enthused womaniser who is always quick witted and seems to be living the lads dream which is always enjoyable to see. Also Tom's father Thomas Sr played by Sydney Pollack is a hilarious addition to the film being an old rich man who has 5 divorces under his belt. The romance in the film is not overpowering but still suitable for the types who seek that in a movie. As the film was set in a united states city and in the Scottish highlands you get quite a contrast of scenery and people which adds an otherwise unattainable aspect to the film of enjoyability. Overall the film was definitely worth a watch and suitable for non romantic comedy lovers - it's a nice chill out film. Oh and I forget to mention that Michelle Monaghan is pretty damn hot!!!\",\n",
              " 'Gladiator is one of my favorite movies to date.Review: While the storyline is fictional, the emperors and their character traits are historical. In both the movie and in history, Marcus Aurelius was a good emperor who cared about Rome but who had a very cruel son (Commodus). The addition of Maximus is not necessarily historical, though Commodus was (SPOILER) assassinated (END SPOILER) by someone. Also, in history Marcus Aurelius allowed Commodus to be his successor, where in the movie, that was not his intent. I thought the storyline was excellent. Extremely gripping and intense. An excellent battle of good vs. evil.Objectionable Content: This IS an R rated movie! Actually though, it really wasn\\'t nearly as bad as I expected. I started watching the movie with expectations of gory battles with blood everywhere. I was pleasantly surprised. It still had some really nasty parts, but as a whole the gory parts were very short and the camera quickly moved on. It is definitely too gory for a PG-13 movie, but it really isn\\'t terrible. As for other objectionable content, profanity is limited to only a few words that are in most PG-13 movies and sex/nudity is practically non-existent. The princess seems to try a couple times to make moves on the married Maximus, but he ignores her and moves on. Commodus also is a bit \"too\" loving and close to his sister (the princess), but nothing is further hinted or shown. Maximus also prays to Roman gods and frequently talks about how he will go into the after-life and be with his family. If that were true, the movie\\'s ending would be much more triumphant. All in all though, objectionable content is fairly minor for an R rated movie.Conclusion: This is a great movie, especially for being rated R. My main problem with it is that Maximus doesn\\'t seem to mind killing the other gladiators much. He voices his thoughts that it is a sick and disgusting form of entertainment, but he still does it. Not that he had a choice, but he only spoke out against it once in the whole movie. Also, the whole movie is about his rise to recognition so that he makes it to the Roman Colliseum, where he can kill Commodus, the evil emperor who killed his family. I don\\'t blame him one bit, as I was furious at Commodus after he told Maximus how he killed his family (probably one of the most sad parts in the whole movie), but from a moral standpoint, it would have been better for Maximus to not take the law into his own hands (although that wouldn\\'t have made a very entertaining movie). My point is that not everything the protagonist does is good and worthy of being a role-model. He is loyal to his family and country however, and he does value life (even though he valued his own life more than the other gladiators he was fighting). All in all, there are some things to be concerned about morally, but all these things are historical. In conclusion though, an excellent movie. Amazing acting (Russel Crowe was awesome!), emotional storyline, awesome CG graphics and scenery, cool battle scenes (even though they can be pretty nasty), and an epic battle of good vs. evil. I loved it. Excellent, very entertaining, and not all that gross. I would recommend this for people who want a serious but awesome movie, and who are above the age of 13. It also has fairly good history, so for Roman history fans this would also be a great look. A definite 9 rating.Extras: DVD - 2 discs, movie in widescreen format, running audio commentary, 11 deleted scenes with or without commentary, as well as unused shots and leftover sequences, the making of Gladiator, a 50 minute feature on gladiators and their contests, a feature about the musical score for Gladiator, a gladiator journal, original storylines for key sequences and deleted sequences (also has conceptual art), a still gallery of portraits, Rome, Germania, the Collosseum, Zucchabar, and behind the scenes, and theatrical teaser and trailer, cast bios, and production notes.',\n",
              " 'I\\'m sure by now everyone knows about this show, so instead of writing the same stuff you\\'ve probably read already, I just want to focus on three things: 1. Yes, they did manage to give it an awesome \\'80s vibe, from the opening sequence to the end credits. Having grown up with these movies myself, I can attest to that. However, I think it will appeal to younger audiences as well. After all, there must be reasons that movies such as \"The Goonies\" and \"E.T.\" remain memorable even now, other than the \"\\'80s vibe\". 2. The creators of the show (the Duffer brothers) have somewhat regretted having Winona Ryder\\'s character acting so hysterically from the start. I disagree with that. That\\'s EXACTLY how a real person would act if *spoiler* happened to her. I hate it when in most movies e.g. the hero loses someone very close to them, then they cry for a brief moment and then it\\'s back to the action. That\\'s ridiculous. 3. I liked how they gradually revealed pieces of the puzzle in every episode. No matter how clever your plot twist/secret is, if the building up period exceeds a certain point, then you\\'ll have created too high expectations and it will be impossible to impress your viewers after that. I\\'m afraid that this will be a one off deal. I\\'m sure that the incredible success of the first season will lead to a second one, but given the plot and the ending, I doubt they\\'ll be able to keep it to as high a level. In my honest opinion, the best case scenario would be if they wrote a similar story with a similar setting and maybe even have the same actors play different roles. I really, really wish they\\'ll prove me wrong, but I\\'m afraid that a direct sequel is doomed to fail. Especially since this was supposed to be a one season show and they only discuss about making a second one because of all its unexpected success.',\n",

              " \"I had heard nothing but good reviews going into Ratatouille, written and directed by Brad Bird. Much like going to a fine restaurant, I was expecting to be impressed. Even though my expectations were high, I was totally blown away by what was served up on the silver screen.Although it's an animated movie, this is NOT a movie made for or directed at kids, although there's enough slapstick and action that kids will enjoy this. It is an extremely well-made movie, with amazing sets, characters, and story, that can stack up against any live-action movie out there.The attention to detail is amazing. From the peeling paint on the shutters of a French cottage, to the cityscape of Paris, to the innards of a French kitchen, the world feels real. And, many of the scenes, which are shot from a rat's-eye point of view, are both frenetic and fascinating to watch.This movie was perfectly cast. Peter O'Toole as a pompous food critic is especially delightful to watch, although it took me until the end of the movie to figure out who was voicing that character. And Linguini, one of the main protagonists, is as tall and thin as his noodle's namesake, a picture of teenage awkwardness.The story is a classic coming-of-age story. Well, sort of. Here, a young adult must find his place in the world, and leave the nest--literally. The main twist, of course, is he's a rat, but there are other surprises in this story which keep the story as fresh as a just-picked sprig of Rosemary.Brad Bird, I salute you for continuing to elevate the genre of animation to an art form that's on par with any movie out there. At the heart of your story is the idea that dreams, even the ones that seem impossible, can come true. Here's to my dream that Ratatouille wins an Oscar--not for Best Animated Feature, but for Best Picture.\",\n",
              " \"The concept of stuntman Mike killing ladies with a car is actually quite hilarious. The name Tarantino credited as the director really makes this a highly anticipated movie. Well, be prepared to be disappointed. Sure, there are a couple of 'cool' scenes in the movie, but overall it is a steaming turd. Tarantino's movies are known for their large amount of witty, rude dialogs. As a matter of fact, that is what made those movies great. This movie also has many dialogs in it, but here they just kill the entire movie. The first 45 minutes are filled with a never ending stream of jibber jabber, while nothing happens in between. Besides that, the conversations are not even clever nor is there any storyline to it. While watching it, I really got the feeling that this movie was actually a non-funny Tarantino-movie-parody. However, I tend to believe that Tarantino simply used some leftover dialogs which were written for, but not used in, his other movies. When something actually does happen the movie is quite amusing, but never great. If Quentin would have cut the crap, there would have been about 30 minutes of entertaining material left. Compared to the other part of the Grindhouse experience, Planet Terror, this movie falls short in every area. While Planet Terror was so over the top with action and bizarre events, this movie just leaves you waiting for something to happen. A movie like Kill Bill was entertaining, but already showed some signs of the fact that Tarantino's ego got so inflated that it gets in the way of his ability to create another classic movie. By the time he got to making this, his head seems to be so far up his own behind, that he can hardly entertain me anymore. I don't know whether I am still looking forward to whatever he will come up with next...\",\n",
              " 'Mark Herman\\'s \"Boy in the Striped Pyjamas\" doesn\\'t quite prepare you to how great it is, simply because everything happens in the end, and gives its full meaning to the poignant but rather predictable material featured in the first two acts.And watching this movie, I knew I would find comments on IMDb echoing my sentiment. After that extraordinary climax, I just told my wife: \"this is the best ending the film could ever have\", and by that, I meant the most logical and satisfying. She thought the film would show something more after that painful shot on the outside of the gas chamber and the remaining clothes, but I knew the film would immediately close, as it had made its point, and quite a powerful one. It\\'s really one of these instances when the last ten minutes of a movie elevate it to a haunting level of greatness.Yes, the film is about a German boy, Bruno (played by Asa Butterfield) who doesn\\'t know the extents of the atrocities committed by the very men he worships (or used to), including his father, which all naturally leads him to befriend a Jewish kid in a death camp, named Schmuel. Yes, childhood innocence at wartime and unlikely friendships are very common themes, and even the encounters between the two boys, at each side of barbed wire fences, doesn\\'t really strike for its originality, but it\\'s all in the last ten minutes, when Bruno dies in the gas chamber, with his friend and other men.And it\\'s not about being happy for Bruno\\'s death but since it was the worst punishment his father (David Thewlis) could ever have, yes it was a worthy sacrifice from a pure \\'Karma\\' standpoint, in order to inflict the heartless officer what he\\'s been routinely conducting toward innocent people. Even worse for him, is that the death of his son could have been easily avoided, if he had simply told him what the camp was about, and what they were doing there. Sure, that would have tarnished Bruno\\'s admiration but he would have thought twice before playing games near the camp. And this is where the characterization of Bruno works and his fate, although tragic, is a great pay-off.Bruno is shown as a rather detached and solitary kid, less passionate and fanatic than his sister Gretel, but he\\'s not all brave and courageous for all that, just curious and sweet. The title with the \\'pyjama\\' description is a hint that the story is seen from an innocent child\\'s perspective. And when Bruno is confronted to that young officer\\'s anger, he denies being Schmuel\\'s friend, which is a rather cowardly move. And even when he enters the camp, he seems very reluctant, so it must have taken one hell of a blind courage to ignore the risks of setting a foot in a camp. And this is the point: Bruno couldn\\'t realize it, not because he was blind, but because he was blinded.The Germans supposedly ignored what happened in the Camp, so that when the Allies and Russians liberated them, they were shocked to discover the truth. Even the news report of a camp was pure propaganda, showing healthy prisoners eating and playing football. The German people believed it, because they wanted to believe it, they didn\\'t want to think their leaders were Barbarians. And Bruno illustrates that mindset, when he sees the newsreel, he goes hug his father, suddenly becoming a good man who takes care of war prisoners. He was blinded by the propaganda, by his father\\'s lies and also by his love as a son, as the Germans loved (for most of them) Hitler. It takes a believer to lie.As for the liar, Bruno\\'s father knew what he did and we can wonder, if he\\'s so proud of his actions and so confident that they\\'re meant to save the German motherland, so why doesn\\'t he openly talk about it? is it guilt or shame? No, pure denial. Denying people their right to live and exist, and denying that these actions are innately evil. The father is so wrapped up in that evil madness that he hypocritically kills people believing it\\'s good while hiding this reality to his son, as if it wasn\\'t so good. And this is where you reach the genius of the film, almost imperceptible, because it doesn\\'t feel like a Spielberg or Polanski\\'s super-production.Indeed, the soul of this film is an evil one. Sure, the father could have come at the last minute, or the shower be a real shower, like in \"Schindler\\'s List\", but the father\\'s arc had to be closed that way. He was the antagonist of the film, and the two kids\\' sacrifices the tool Destiny or Karma or God used to punish him. In fact, the film works like a reverse \"Life is Beautiful\", while Benigni pretended it was a game to keep his son\\'s innocence and save his life, in \"The Boy in Striped Pyjamas\", the reality of the death camp is ignored by Bruno, and his maintained innocence ironically seals his fate.It\\'s a tragic film but the irony is delightful because the father is responsible for his kids\\' obliviousness to the danger of the camp. And there\\'s more to that, it is often asked how come the prisoners never fought or how come the Jews let themselves being arrested. Apart from the fact that this question ignores some heroic resistances, it also shows the sad reality, many of the Jewish people who died in these camps didn\\'t know they would die, or that it would go as far as being separated from their families and put in gas chambers. And when you think about it, Bruno and even Schmuel, had the same mindset.Anything could happen, but death... yet it did, it was the most tragically satisfying ending the film could get.',\n",

Casting especially Kevin Bacon was spot on for Sebastian Shaw, the storyline was dramatic and non-stop action. I can't applaud enough for the script writers. Each character was brought on to life from the comics and well acted. I like how the characters are developed from young until how they become. There is even a History Lesson. Even the villains were recognizable, and at a certain perception the audience will get a feel of how they feel. Don't expect storyline and plots to be taken right out of the X-Men comics. This movie has bring the comics to justice. Don't need to research before seeing this movie. Just come with an open mind. Can't wait for the sequel.\",\n",
              " \"Napoleon Dynamite is a simple film, obviously made on a low budget, with none of the usual American glitz and glam. It is dry, kind of dark, extremely strange and absolutely hilariously funny. Jon Heder is absolutely perfect in the role of Napoleon, as are all the other cast members, especially Kip, the nerdy, net-chatting brother. The thing that is fantastic about this film is that despite being completely odd and having bizarre, eccentric characters, many of the characters, or some of their traits, are familiar to us. Who hasn't known a Napoleon (though doubtless as funny as this one) who is completely off-centre, strange and offbeat, a complete nerd in full, who nonetheless seems unaware of the fact that they are, in fact, a complete nerd, and this lack of caring or awareness makes them somewhat cool. Brother Kip is hilarious for this reason as well - a computer-obsessed nerd who thinks he is cool, despite being adorably dorky. Uncle Rico is a believable egocentric man, and Pedro is the strange foreign student who, of course, bonds with the outcast Napoleon. The casting in this movie is perfect, the popular people at his school are so realistic, especially the girls during the lame dance at the end. Absolutely hilarious how spot on these characters are. The film has the most unique and clever dialogue I've ever heard in a movie, it seems to create it's only language-for-dorks, which is fantastically funny. The ending dance scene is fabulous, as for the very first time Napoleon is seen as cool, and accepted by his fellow peers after his on-stage dance, yet he flees before the applause begins, and probably never is even aware of this. It makes this scene so much more special, typical Napoleon not having to prove himself to anyone, even when they do love him for it. He and his girl make the cutest couple, on a side note. I recommend watching this film at least twice - the first time, you just aren't sure what is happening and if you should be laughing or not (although I was), but the second viewing makes you find it absolutely hilarious, and every time after that as well. Funny, clever, exceedingly strange, with perfect casting and enough classic quotes to last you for ages, Napoleon Dynamite is one of the best films released in modern times. Highly recommended, but don't try to read into it, whatever you do - it is the film's simplicity which makes it so fun and easy to watch.\",\n",

It\\'s a nice change to have cop who was paralyzed from the neck down. The character of Eddie Ortiz was hilarious, and Queen Latifah was also brilliant although her role wasn\\'t very big.However, the ending was very clich√©. Keep in mind that the killer\\'s true identity was VERY hard to predict. But his REASONS for killing Linkin were pretty lame. Another serial killer out on a revenge path? Geez, where have I seen that before? Also, it doesn\\'t really make sense that if the Linkin\\'s doctor was the killer, then that means they were in the room together countless times since Linkin\\'s accident. Not to mention that there\\'s one line that clearly states, \"Jesus, he was trying to send messages even then.\" So he would have had plenty of opportunities when Linkin was alone in his apartment with just Thelma, who the doc killed anyway. Amelia coming up behind him and shooting him in the back JUST in time was incredibly predictable as well.One last thing. This movie would\\'ve been SO much better, clich√© ending and all, if there hadn\\'t been any romance between Amelia and Linkin!Anyhow, still worth watching.6/10',\n",
              " 'There are couple of things to discuss about Steven Spielberg\\'s \"Lincoln\". Despite what the title implies, the movie is not the life story of the sixteenth president. Rather, it focuses on late 1864 and early 1865, when the reelected Lincoln was trying to get the Thirteenth Amendment passed to outlaw slavery. What we see is how Lincoln had to scratch a few backs to ensure the amendment\\'s passage. Similar things happen to this day.But there\\'s an even more important clear analogy to the present day. When the proposal to ban slavery gets brought before congress, a number of congressmen attack it as things like \"an attack on freedom\" or \"an overreach of government power\". In later years, the reactionary forces in the United States said the same sorts of things about the Civil Rights Act, and today the Tea Party types say the same sorts of things about today\\'s social progress.Does the movie have any drawbacks? Well, there\\'s not much look at the war itself, except for a scene of disembodied limbs on a battlefield, and there\\'s not much look at slavery, except for a photo of a whipped slave. Of course, one could make the argument that these aren\\'t supposed to be the main focus of what Lincoln had to do in order to get the Thirteenth Amendment passed.Above all else, the movie shows Abraham Lincoln\\'s human side. The sixteenth president saw that ending slavery would take significant ambition, and he did what he felt that he had to in order to carry out this objective. It\\'s not Spielberg\\'s best movie, but it\\'s definitely up there. Daniel Day-Lewis brings a fine embodiment to Abraham Lincoln, as does Sally Field as his wife Mary. Providing impeccable support are Joseph Gordon-Levitt, David Strathairn, Hal Holbrook, James Spader, and Tommy Lee Jones.',\n",
              " 'This is a somber and somewhat dark full-length feature film from Disney, a tale about deformed bell-ringer Quasimodo, confined in the bell tower of Notre Dame by the cold and heartless Judge Claude Frollo, who finds independence to help his new friend, gypsy dancer Esmeralda, escape the hands of the vicious Frollo.Like The Lion King, it was filmed with what I think is a more mainstream Hollywood approach: serious and some egotistic characters, dramatic and a few disturbing scenes and some adult language like \"hell\" and \"SOB.\" As a result, it is apparent that you could tell some slapstick comic relief was forced in to lighten up what is otherwise a serious movie.Though the Disney touch is absent, it is an intriguing and suspenseful movie - full of courage, heroism and adventure. Helped by a solid plot, nice music and songs and memorable characters, this film is overall entertaining for the entire audience.Grade B+',\n",

              " \"'Bhagwaan hai kahaan re tu...' gave me goosebumps all over my body and my eyes were wet! I was literally thrilled. What a masterpiece Raju Hirani has created on celluloid! And hats off to Aamir Khan. It takes a lot of courage to make such a statement in this country as pk does. Challenging the stupid norms and rituals that our society has been teaching us for ages is like catching a star in the night sky and trying to push it towards the moon. You can think like you are actually doing it but it really never happens. So will be the case with pk. All of us will watch pk, realize what foolish activities we keep on doing everyday, laugh at ourselves, and continue doing the same activities. It is not going to affect our lifestyle in any way. But still pk is a very special film due to two primary factors. First, Aamir Khan. What a remarkable performance! It does not get better than this; performance of a lifetime! If you think Hrithik Roshan's portrayal of Rohit in Koii Mil Gaya is the best performance by any actor in a 'special' character, Aamir's pk will surely make you doubt that. The sanity and the dedication with which he has performed every scene in the film is simply mesmerizing. Second, Rajkumar Hirani, of course. His direction is superb. But the screenplay and editing is not perfect. A few scenes are rushed and abrupt. The Sushant-Anushka love plot has been dealt in a great hurry, which looks odd. Sanjay Dutt's lovable act could also have been a bit longer. But pk is very much Hirani's film and he proves once again what a fantastic story-teller he is! All said and done, pk is not a 10/10 film for me. There are a few disappointing reasons why. First, the antagonist, played by Saurabh Shukla, is not strong enough. It seems like an enlarged enactment of the actor's 'Batuk maharaj' from Lagey Raho Munna Bhai. Being the brand ambassador of all-the-stupid-stuff-happening-around, Tapasvi ji should have been a much stronger character. Second, the climax is hurried and not a very convincing conclusion to the issue has been put forward. I don't mean to say that the climax is bad. But it's just about okay. It could have been much better. Bottomline: pk is a film which none would even dare to make! And here they have made it and I don't know how! It is a very difficult film to make and has been made with near perfection. pk in my view is definitely the best entertainer in the last 5 years (post 3 idiots). One of Bollywood's best offerings!\",\n",
              " 'Magnolia is hands down one of the best movies I have ever seen. I\\'m a huge movie fan and I watch 3-4 movies per week on average. And therein may lie the clue to its enjoyment. The average movie goer may see one flick a week at the most and provide the box office fuel for such tripe as Godzilla and Deuce Bigalow. This movie isn\\'t for those kinds of John Doe \"block buster\" movie goers. This movie is for true fans of film as art in the style of Scorsese and Altman. It isn\\'t your standard movie experience. If a long unconventional movie isn\\'t your thing, avoid avoid avoid.The movie\\'s theme is the tragic result of self centered-ness. The kind that is so prevalent in post WWII America. The theme seems to be lost on so many of the viewers I saw the film with, as well as many of the reviewers here on imdb. That we are shown at least 9 different people going through this self centered-ness is a vital element to the film. It shows the pervasiveness with which this self absorption exists in our society. In the film it occurs within the span of one day, in one city in 9 different lives. To say life isn\\'t this bad, or that people just aren\\'t this desperate or self absorbed in this day and age is to just have blinders in. People will blast this movie and then leave the theater to blow up at someone who cut them off on the freeway, then drop their 2 year old off at all day day care, oblivious to the failure of their own lives. The manifestations of this kind of life are shown in glorious, overblown detail: drug addiction, blind careerism, selfishness, parents pushing their kids to excel, molestation, adultery. The heart is hardened in every way possible and the capacity to truly love is shut out. The results, as shown in brilliant performances by Jason Robards and Phillip Baker Hall, are agonizing regret and guilt towards the end of life. The brilliant Biblical allegory towards the end of the film (which to my utter surprise several people did not get ...\"what\\'s with the frogs\"? I heard several people say)only goes to hammer these points home. Reprehensible lives such as these are worthy of a plague.At least to me, this film serves to drive the same point home as \"American Beauty\" did: Love, compassion and beauty are the only things that matter in life, not the careers, material gains and self pleasures we surround ourselves with. There is certainly a stylistic difference between the two films. AB is thoroughly realistic, Magnolia drives its message home with parody and occasional over-acting to brilliant effect. I mean come on people, look at the Tom Cruise seminar in the hotel..the material in the package he sells. It\\'s obvious this over dramatization is not realistic, it is meant to prove a point.I do have one minor complaint, and that is certain parts of the film where Aimee Mann\\'s songs are used. I\\'m not referring to the cast sing along of Wise Up which I though was brilliant, but to the use of Momentum and One. At certain points the songs are playing top volume, at the same time the score is playing beneath, and then dialogue on top of that. I found this to be very distracting and annoying. This isn\\'t a slight against Mann, who is a songwriter on par with Lennon or Dylan, but the effect was a little too overwhelming.So you will either revel in the overblowness of it all, and get the message, or see the film as a contrived jarring mess. Maybe some of us could open our minds to see the former.',\n",
              " '\"Live and die by this day\" Perhaps the most fitting tag line for this film, and for so many reasons, which you will discover once you have seen it.I must say that I had fairly low expectations for this film. I was expecting a fairly predictable and somewhat clich√© survival flick and it was probably only out of respect and admiration for Liam Neeson that I paid to watch it at the big screen. It was a decision that was well and truly vindicated. The film has an incredible presence and atmosphere it was almost spiritual. So much of what you see is symbolic and metaphoric and it reaches you on a much deeper level. In many respects this film is less about survival and more about accepting and embracing our own mortality. Some of the most poignant and haunting scenes are generated from a subtle facial expression or the wind howling in the background. Just a beautifully shot film filled with raw emotional energy with so many subtle subplots and character exploration which becomes so engrossing its almost addictive. My biggest piece of advice would be to go in to this film open minded and try to engage the philosophic undertones throughout and you will surely find the experience riveting',\n",
              " \"America's fascination with all things Sandler proves there is a devil, and Satan purchased this lame comedian's soul about 10 years ago.Granted, Sandler's performance in 'Punch Drunk Love' was charmingly off-beat. However, his nuanced delivery was more the work of director Paul T. Anderson, who knew to keep Sandler under a tight reign, rather than any innate talent.What we have here is a single joke (and I use the term 'joke' extremely loosely) 'comedy' that grows tired before the opening credits finish rolling. The very premise of the film, that Sandler essentially ignores ALL responsibilities (including earning a living) for several months to set up an elaborate scheme to restore Barrymore's memory, is purely idiotic. A lot of less-than-brilliant people seem to find this movie romantic, but if this is what passes for 'romance' these days, we are all doomed. The secondary-characters are caricatures of people that were never entertaining to begin with. In fact, there is not one single thing in this movie that makes it worth recommending -- it's not funny, the plot is stupid, there is not one memorable quote and the characters are all boring, lacking coherent motivation.Even the ending scene, meant to be endearing, is just plain moronic. SPOILER: Barrymore has a child with a guy that she 'meets' for the first time every single day? Their daughter is going to have some remarkable life with a mother that forgets giving birth daily. Just like the rest of this movie, this theme is pathetic and stupid.Fortunately for me (and hopefully a few other sane people remaining on this planet), I avoided Satan's command to 'love Sandler no matter what garbage he gets paid $20,000,000 to do.' If you have an IQ in the double digits, avoid this turd. 2/10\",\n",

If you want to see really good computer animation that will amuse you, inspire your children to be good and strong and true, and which predates this shallow and uninspiring vehicle, check out the television series Reboot, now being re-run on Cartoon Network.

It was terrible! Hard to watch. Acting was awful! Must be some studio minions hyping this movie?!?I am very surprised that anyone liked Marky Mark over Shia, it was not a good casting at all. Wahlberg was great in Lone survivor, Broken City, The Fighter, Invincible... but in this movie he was supposed to play a neurotic failed robot inventor and he floundered. It was extremely poor acting reminiscent of Pain and Gain, another failed attempt by Wahlberg at neuroses. The description says he is a mechanic, I was expecting Sparkplug: a dumb jock but loyal and hard working (where Wahlberg excels) but instead I am supposed to buy him as a sub-genius robotics inventor/ former football star? At least with Shia he played the neurotic role well. It is what Shia does well and what we expect from him. Wahlberg doesn't fit this role at all and clearly this was not written with him in mind. Other than the poor casting and worse acting, this movie fails exactly where the newest Superman and the newest Thor movies did: no plot, overdone CGI, and seemingly invincible antagonists and protagonists. I hope Hollywood gets a clue that when you have two invincible enemies fighting and destroying whole cities or worlds it is not entertaining! Especially when one of them is killed in one swift sequence. The insurmountable odds concept only works with quick wits, and a great plot.\",\n",
              " 'When I first saw it in the theater I was 15 years old and I thought it was one of the best movies I ever saw. It was some fun to come back to it 15 years later. At this point I can see that there\\'s a lot of humor in there, whereas as a younger person I took it very seriously. Verhoeven is a very good director, and this is one of his better films -- he is able to give us a film that is complex but at the same time not obtrusively so. You can kind of take and leave what you want from Verhoeven\\'s glossy satire. Schwarzenneger\\'s performance is one of his best, one of the only times he played an actual human being with anything like believability. A lot of times his physical mass prevents him from passing as \"normal\", but here his stature just adds to the sense that something is wrong in the first place with him being this peaceful construction worker, and adds some irony to the fact that this man is made so helpless by the mental tinkerers at \"Total Rekall\", a place where you can buy the memory of a vacation if you don\\'t have time to take an actual trip.The violence is so extreme that it\\'s at times sickening, but I just find it all humorous because I don\\'t really take the movie all that seriously. A lot of people laugh when they hear that Phil Dick wrote the source story, but this film actually sticks a lot closer to its source material than \"Blade Runner\" or \"Minority Report\" or any of the other more \"respected\" Dick adaptions that I\\'ve seen. It\\'s worth pointing out that while the moments of extreme violence in Ridley Scott\\'s \"Blade Runner\" sometimes feel like arbitrary concessions to the action movie audience and don\\'t feel fully integrated into the film\\'s somber tone, Verhoeven\\'s film is consistently giddy, turbulent, and fast, making the violence seem more natural to his film\\'s glossy aesthetic.I think Ron Cox did some good work here but basically Michael Ironside stole the show as far as villains go. He\\'s the definition of a \"loose cannon\", so jealous of Quaid\\'s (Schwarzenneger) connection with his gal Lori (Sharon Stone, appropriately feral) that he becomes a figure who\\'s both sympathetic and terrifying. Rachel Ticotin is merely serviceable, rather underwhelming considering she\\'s given a meaty role for the love interest in an action film.Special notice should go to the great Rob Bottin and his company for some of his most impressive animatronic work \\x96 which is saying a lot. Maybe the effects are a bit aged now, but they are quality effects, and I predict that they will stand the test of time better than most computer generated effects films. This was one of the last big effects films to use only actual photographic elements for all its shots. It features an impressive matte/miniature shot that takes us from the inside of a train to the Martian landscape and ultimately soaring above Mars\\' domed cities \\x96 a shot that is very close to one that was planned for the beginning of \"Blade Runner\" but abandoned for financial reasons.As a Phil Dick adaption, it\\'s an interesting case because even though as stated above the film sticks somewhat closer to Dick\\'s original than most adaptions have done (\"Minority Report\" deserves particular shame for introducing the exploitative element of the deceased child), it is also the furthest in tone and feeling from Dick\\'s work in some ways. It captures his paranoia about identity and memory control with great accuracy. Simply for communicating such a complex idea \\x96 that a person\\'s identity could actually be changed by artificial intelligence technology \\x96 to the popcorn-munching millions (like my own former 15-year-old self). And in the end we have a film that is essentially a top-notch action film that\\'s crossed over into \"The Twilight Zone\". Schwartzenneger, whose 2 other best films IMHO were the similarly sci-fi flavored \"Terminator\" and \"Predator\", must have known this, as he reportedly took a personal interest in the project before production began. He put his heart in the film in a way he never had before and never did again. For his part, Verhoeven returned to a similar turf in \"Starship Troopers\", which was also a fun movie but perhaps not quite as much fun as this one or \"Robocop\". So this is also a career peak for him as well.',\n",

There was not much focus on the character of the killer, and that was I think the major flaw. I did like the acting of the girls. The stunts were very nice and deserve thumbs up. The storyline was unusual and new being kind of based upon stunt men but it finally finished not more than a physcotic film with some good action sequences.

              " \"Hairspray is based on a Broadway musical of the same name that starred Rikki Lake and tells the tale of a young girl named Tracey(played by newcomer Nikki Blonsky)who lives in Baltimore with her parents(played by Christopher Walken and John Travolta(yup im really not kidding here but John was done up in drag as a woman in this movie crazy right).Tracey dreams of starring in the Corny Collins show which is hosted by Corny Collins(played by the lovely James Marsden)and drags her BFF(best friend forever) played by Amanda Bynes to help her get on the show. But of course there is competition with Michelle Pfeiffer and Brittany Snow's characters who would do anything but to be in the Corny Collins show and ruin Tracey's dream to star with Corny Collins and a hunky guy called Link (played by High School Musical star Zac Efron who looks like a young Elvis Presley I must say in this movie). So will Tracey's dreams of starring in the Corny Collins show come true and can she help Queen Latifah's charcther a spot at the Corny Collins show too?Bottom line is this, its a feel good musical to watch on a lazy Sunday afternoon with some catchy songs (that will have you humming or not)and a great supporting cast from John Travolta as Edna (in drag),Nikki Blonsky,Zac Efron,James Marsden,Amanda Bynes and co. SO do I like it sure its a good flick,its not the best film in the world but I enjoyed myself watching it.Overall its a 7/10\",\n",
              " \"Forgetting the book and the stick it's got attached to it, the film was directed and played out perfectly. It has everything in it, humour, romance, comedy and passion. It's a film of it's own with nothing to compare it to - hence why everyone is so negative (because most people don't like change and something new). Great story line, doesn't promote abusive relationships as both are consenting adults, shows how two people from other ends of the earth can come together and take one another for who they are - with all their faults. 10/10 from me!

              " \"This is what American cinema ought to be. Hell or High Water is set in small towns with its steak houses, bars, secluded houses and oil derricks. It was smooth and entertaining like a well written crime fiction novel. I liked the unconventional and charming small town characters and their working class lives. I liked the plump waitress a lot (!). Everyone acted well. Nice locales. Awesome soundtrack. Taylor Sheridan is a writer to watch out for. Even though Sicario was just OK.I was not a big Ben Foster fan before this film came out. But he did a good job here. Chris Pine who played the subdued and confused brother was a perfect foil for the rough and impulsive Ben Foster. This is one of the best American films I've seen in a while. I am not saying this is as good as the American films of the 40s, 50s and 70s. But this is as good as it gets for 21st century American cinema.Jeff Bridges and Gil Birmingham deserve special mention for their chemistry and their back and forth digs at each other. I hope there are more films like Hell or High Water and not too many films about Mark Zuckeberg.\",\n",
              " 'SPOILERS It\\'s almost unheard of for a piece of comedy genius to also be so deeply meaningful and philosophical. Yet, in 1993\\'s \"Groundhog Day\", writer Danny Rubin has created something very special. Hilarious at times and often quite deep, this film is deservedly praised by everyone who sees it.Phil Connors (Bill Murray) is an arrogant news reader. Travelling to Puxatony to witness the world famous Groundhog Day, Connors finds himself repeating this day over and over. With none of his actions affecting his life, Connors firstly experiments with life before realising that he could well be stuck repeating this same day for eternity.This light hearted comedy is perhaps Bill Murray\\'s finest performance. Going through a renaissance of sorts since the Millennium, Murray has evolved into a much more serious actor. Deservedly Oscar nominated for \"Lost In Translation\" (2004), Murray is at his funniest all these years back in 1993. Rude and self obsessed to begin with, the transformation of Murray\\'s character is pure genius as he relives the same day continuously until he learns the error of his ways and wins the girl (played surprisingly well by Andie MacDowell).The social commentary of this film is absolutely superb. The way Connors is able to often deceive others with prior knowledge is superb. As, most notably, is the way that Andie MacDowell\\'s Rita can so magically change her opinion of Phil the second that she finds out that he plays an instrument. Rita is actually just as superficial as Connors and truthfully it would be brilliant to see how well the two coped over the following few months after the film ended.Personally the finest Philosophical story about this film is the death of the old homeless guy. Irrelevant of how Connors acts, this man always dies at the same point of the day. As the doctor says \\'it was just his time\\'. This quote is brilliant because it suggests that however we live our lives, when we are due to die, we are due to die. This is one of the most important, most powerful, messages of the film, and it is delivered with subtlety and beauty. Full marks to director Harold Ramis for this one five minute period of skill.It\\'s easy to over think the intelligence of \"Groundhog Day\". Yes first and foremost it is a comedy, but it is also incredibly easy to see more depth in a generally simple comedy. So, as a comedy, let us consider it\\'s main points. Well, firstly it is a hilarious piece of work which is well written and adequately shot. Secondly it is brilliantly acted by everyone involved, including the usually awful Andie MacDowell. Finally, it is a feel good story which leaves you with a smile on your face. So whether you think of the film as being deep or whether you view it as a simple romantic comedy, it is perfect on either level. It is genuinely an excellent film.Brilliant on so many levels, \"Groundhog Day\" is one of the finest romantic comedies of all time. Daft but entertaining, it features a great performance by Bill Murray as well as a potentially deep message. All in all, it\\'s just a superb entertaining film and it should be watched at all costs.',\n",
              " 'Lindsay Lohan has been in some real stinkers, most notably \"I Know Who Killed Me.\" However, \"Mean Girls\" is surprisingly refreshing, original, and entertaining. The mixture of Tina Fey\\'s killer screenplay and great acting talent by the cast makes this a rather memorable picture.Comparing this to \"Heathers\" is like comparing apples and oranges, I think. \"Heathers\" is much, much, much, much, much darker and satirical than \"Mean Girls\". \"Mean Girls\" is more of a real snapshot of what high school life can be like. True, the characters are mostly stereotypical and one-dimensional, but the message of the movie - the importance of friendship - shines through these insanely confined stereotypes.',\n",
              " \"The Equalizer starring Denzel Washington is a nicely written story, that is based on the hit 1980s television show of the same name starring Edward Woodward, which ran for four seasons. While I never had the chance to watch the television series before the film, I truly believe this hardcore action film did it justice. If you want a hard R action film with over the top violence and fantastic acting, this is the film for you. The following is my review of The Equalizer.The film was written by Richard Wenk who recently wrote such films as The Expendables 2 and The Mechanic. So his experience is basically in minimal story action films. Frankly though, in this film, that doesn't show at all. The characters are written greatly for the most part, and the depth of the characters carries the film. The story follows Robert McCall(Denzel Washington as he is a man with a mysterious past and we learn a little about that past as the story follows along. McCall has been laying low and working at a home improvement store. As bad events break out around him, his past experience finally get it's calling once more. McCall delivers so much mayhem in this film, and without spoiling the movie, I cannot correctly described the mayhem McCall brings to the bad guys in this film, though I will not be delivering those spoilers. The film has many slow parts to it. If you walk into the movie expecting action non stop throughout the majority of the film, you will leave disappointed. However, if you can hold judgement until the film is completely over, you will find a fantastic action film. In the slower moving scenes of the film, the acting really pays off. So, overall Wenk delivers a solid story will an amazing pay off for us true action fans.The film was directed by Antoine Fuqua who is well known for such films as Training Day, Shooter, and the big hit of 2013 Olympus Has Fallen. While this film doesn't have the pacing of Olympus Has Fallen, the action, when it does pop up, is fierce and close to stomach turning. There are a good bit of nicely innovative death scenes to leave you wanting more as you leave the theater. With only a few major action scenes, Fuqua brings some nice camera work in the close combat fighting scenes. While I cannot say the effort is perfect, if you go to the theater expecting a fun action film with tons of violence, then you will greatly enjoy your time during this film. As I mentioned above the film does slow down as the story builds up. With great acting from Denzel Washington, Chlo√´ Grace Moretz, Marton Csokas, and David Harbour, the slower story building scenes are well worth watching if you enjoy some character driven elements. Denzel always dominates the roles he is in, and while he goes a step up in this film, I really felt Marton Csokas(Teddy) plays a fantastic bad guy, even if he is written somewhat inept at times. Overall, Fuqua delivers some amazing fun with The Equalizer, and fans of fun action and great acting will really enjoy his efforts.The film was composed by Harry Gregson-Williams who has recently scored such films as Total Recall(2012) and Cowboys & Aliens. I really enjoy a score that adds amazing depth, and the score from Harry Gregson-Williams is fantastic. When the action picks up towards the end of the film, there is a wonderful piece that played, and it honestly got me at the edge of my seat during the nail biting scene. If you really enjoy a nice score with your film, the effort Harry Gregson-Williams delivers is top notch in this film.Overall, if you enjoy some action fun, this is clearly the film for you. The film has its faults, and could be considered boring at times as the film has a good bit of character driven dialogue. Some may consider that a minus but, with such an amazing cast of actors, you barely even notice that. The film features a lot of over the top action scenes via hand to hand combat and some interesting death scenes which should get even the most picky fans out to the theater. Frankly, if you are reading this review, I highly recommend this film to everyone. There is no reason to miss this film. It was that amazing and enjoyable.I also want to touch on the IMAX version of the film, as this is the version I watched. For a ticket price of fifteen dollars(in my area, could be higher or lower in your area), the extra money is not really worth it unless your theater's other screens are sub-par. This IMAX version, as usual, adds amazing depth with the sound. However, since the film was not actually shot using IMAX cameras, the image doesn't live up to IMAX films that were actually shot with IMAX cameras. I would say it is personal preference but, with tickets in IMAX costing so much, you might want to save the extra five dollars or so, unless you can get a discount showing.8/10\",\n",
              " 'As I left the theater, I overheard bad comments coming from behind me- \"I couldn\\'t get into that story\" \"Man, this movie kinda sucked\" \"I don\\'t know what that was all about\" It\\'s true that the same flock of people that came in expecting \"Blade\" like flick, or perhaps \"The Matrix\" of vampires and werewolves, would probably be disappointed. The movie doesn\\'t stay on one concept, it\\'s lower budget (23 million) gives it less CGI and smaller, reused locations, and the touted romance between main characters Michael (Scott Speedman, kinda boring) and Selene (played well by Kate Beckinsale) never really has time to develop. But if you take a closer look at the story, you\\'ll find some interesting aspects.Vampires and werewolves have fought for many centuries, with the vamps having the upper hand. They live in large mansions above ground, while the werewolves live in underground sewer-like conditions. The war between them is about to become worse, and in the thick of it is Selene who suspects a conspiracy, one that may eventually lead to an attack by the werewolves. Lucian (Michael Sheen), is the leader of the werewolves. His rage is one that will lead to secrets that unfold later in the movie. As they hunt down a human who carries what is needed to create super \\'werevamps\\', Selene has to deal with the clan at home. No one seems to believe her that something very nasty is about to happen. Which is too bad, since, in this movie, everyone here seems to go with their gut feelings and fantastic insights on what other people are thinking and doing.Acting wise, everything is as expected, but Shane Brolly, who plays Kraven, the leader of the vampires, does a rather poor job. He did not convince me, as an actor, that he was a leader, and when he gets upset, he looks like a little kid who had his blood candy stolen. Kate Beckinsale and Michael Sheen are quite good, however.Action sequences were a bit mixed. There was hi-tech gun play, and there was plenty of it, but the actual confrontation sequences left a lot to be desired. Usually what you saw when it came to the hand-to-hand shots were closeups of the werewolves teeth... cut to the next smoke filled fight scene, wash, rinse, repeat.Rules of how vampires get killed were changed a bit. In here, they can die rather easily in comparison to other vamp movies like this one. But water doesn\\'t hurt them, that\\'s for sure, since half the movie is drenched in rain. Perhaps to balance the werewolves weaknesses? Roleplaying games, books and movies have gone through various different ways of rules that can be applied to how vamps and wolves function, so this is a moot point.SFX department- with Editor Martin Hunter and several dozen visual effects techs didn\\'t do a bad job. With hardly any CGI in site they manage to do a bang up job with the werewolves\\' changes. The locations where the movie was shot, Prague and Budapest, give the movie a very authentic feel.Overall, the movie had more potential then what you see, perhaps a little more on the romance side? Better characters? But hey, I still liked it.Just don\\'t expect oscar winning performances, mind-blowing CGI sfx, or originality. Just sit back and enjoy the film for what it is.7 out of 10',\n",
              " \"Finding your niche in high school could be difficult. As a junior, walking down the hallway of a new high school for the first time it can be overwhelming. In the case of Cady Heron, who moved from Africa, to discover her niche she had to find the right friends and adapt to the culture of North Shore. This would prove to be a daunting task. The movie Mean Girls is all about the typical high school experience, the queen-bee and her followers, the cattiness between girls, and the always present drama because of boys. Most teenage girls have seen Mean Girls multiple times because it is a comedy filled with drama that has become a sleepover hit. Whether it is your first time or your tenth time to watch it, you are guaranteed to laugh and at times relate to the experiences of Cady Heron. I personally liked the movie Mean Girls because it was all about the extremities of high school girls and their desire to fit in with the most popular girls on campus. The Plastics, the most popular girls, Regina George and her two followers, can make you transform from a typical high school girl to a Plastic wannabe. The Plastics seemed to be perfect in everyone's eyes but their own. Every girl in high school desired to be like them. The Plastics set the fashion trends. When queen-bee, Regina George had circles cut out of her tank top during gym and her bra was seen under it, almost every other girl in school cut holes in their tank top to be just like her. The Plastics practically ran the school; they had so much control over the other girls, they even had control over the teachers and the principal. The Plastics got away with breaking school dress code, ruining other girl's relationships, lying, hooking up with guys during school, backstabbing and making The Burn Book. Ethically the movie shows the typical high school girl cattiness. Queen-bee Regina George is tricked by the new Plastic, Cady Heron, into losing her hot body, her group of friends and her boyfriend Aaron Samuels. Logically no school principal would ever allow a group of girls to become so powerful or get away with as much as they did but adding that to the movie made it more entertaining. Tina Fey eloquently wrote the script for Mean Girls, in a way the viewers could emotionally attach to the characters. The viewers felt as though they made the transformation from human to plastic with Cady Heron. I believe Mean Girls was written in order to make people laugh. Tina Fey exaggerated typical high school experiences but presented them in a way that is not so different than real life. The depiction of girl on girl cattiness is very realistic and the struggle to be queen-bee is a picturesque description of a high school girls climb to the top of popularity. There was an actual value to the movie. I feel it taught teenage girls the price of becoming Plastic was not worth changing themselves. In the end, being cordial with everyone makes high school less dramatic. Although, Tina Fey may have depicted some extreme behaviors, Mean Girls, was designed to entertain the viewers and that is exactly what it accomplished. I would give this movie eight out of ten stars because it made me laugh and kept me emotionally attached. The transformation of Cady Heron, from a regular human girl into a Plastic girl was presented in a way that audiences of all ages could relate to.\",\n",
              " \"Loved this movie. Yea it is not like the more recent Sandler movies (all age appropriate) but it is like his earlier works. Very funny shows friends and family stick together and good times. This one is more like the Happy Gilmore and Billy Madison movies. One thing I appreciate about Adam Sandler is that he keeps his buddies in his movies. Hated rob was not in this one but what ever his reason (new baby or didn't like the role) maybe he will come back for the next. I see so many neg ratings but its because so many were expecting this to be a family oriented movie but they should have known better. Now I did not like Zohan and not really grandma's boy, but all the others are funny. Having Shaq and Stone Cold are added bonuses. I do not care for the gross comedy but this movie had more not so gross funny lines. Loved the cliff jump well I won't give any away but sure many of the more adult directed lines could have been worked to a more family base but then it wouldn't be a Happy Madison movie. I don't think that people or critics should base their ratings on expecting this to be like others or for making the error to take kids to this movie before checking it out first. Adam is known for childish pranks or funny gross comedy in his movies and for someone to not expect it is their own thinking error. This movie is great and funny, if I haven't said it enough. But it is not for children unless you want to answer some awkward questions and not for the weak stomached. This movies shows how family and friends stick together and to over come some life obstacles. All in all my family loved it. Though several moments I had to turn away like the principle eating out of his belly button. Gross! But it is just like a Sandler movie. Even my favorites. Wedding Singer and 50 first dates had its Sandler gross comedy and yelling childish moments. So get past those and it is awesome! Oh and Taylor Lawtner being in it had many taking their younger girls to see him and ended up answering some odd questions. Yet I found his roll to make him look stupid and spoiled that was what his roll was written to be and he pulled it off. Rob made the remark that Sandler makes his cast look like idiots but that is what makes people laugh and he doesn't make them take on the rolls. Besides there are too many horror movies there need to be more comedies and I applaud Sandler for creating these awesome movies. He has made some directed for all family members but he isn't a kid these are buddy movies to sit around and laugh. I rate the critics a 1 star and this movie a 10********** and I wait the next installment and hope I can let my daughter watch.

              " \"I was lucky enough to get the Alien box set on bluray for christmas this year, so I thought this might be a good chance to start posting my reviews of them. There wasn't much on tv last night apart from xmas movies so I thought to hell with this, i'm watching Alien. =PSo the plot to begin with isn't overly complicated. The crew on a deep space mining barge called the Nostromo is woken out of cryo sleep by the ships computer (Mother). They find out that Mother has surprisingly intercepted a transmitter beacon of unknown origins and it's primary company (Weyland-Yutani) is sending the crew in to investigate. Once they realize that it isn't exactly what they were expecting and things going horribly wrong (I won't spoil it for people who haven't yet seen it) from that point onwards it's a classic fight for survival and a terrifying battle against the unknown.The opening scenes around the breakfast table does a good job of introducing us to the seven members of the crew, including a young and VERY gorgeous looking Sigourney Weaver. We see the conflict between Dallas, the ships captain, and the other crew members debating whether they actually need to investigate this signal, the influence of money is what determines their motivation to do it as failure to adhere to company policy will result in a zero paycheck.The thing Alien is best at is building tension. right from the opening titles with the soft, eerie music score we can tell straight away what kind of movie it's going to be. The dark and mechanical atmosphere of the Nostromo sets the backbone of this movie perfectly and it's dark, metallic, maze like corridors and junctions works so well to create such a spooky and claustrophobic environment, and the workhorse, pig headed, hostile attitude of the crew helps set the scene for the film. The slow and methodical buildup is what makes this film so powerful and even after the s*it hits the fan, the tension doesn't stop there. The latter parts of the film where they split up into groups to search for the Alien, the scene where Brett is trying to catch Jonesie (the ships cat), and the scene where Dallas is crawling around in the vent shafts with his only source of light being his makeshift flamethrower, it's almost 40 years on, but god damn the tension is still very much alive to this day and STILL has you feeling that raw fear.Even the theme of the word Alien itself makes an impact. It's the theme of dealing with a foreign species, the theme of dealing with the unknown, the themes of space and fear and isolation and claustrophobia. all of these themes combine together to create an extremely fearful and powerful horror experience. If you haven't seen Alien yet, What in gods name is wrong with you? JUST SEE IT ALREADY!\",\n",
              " 'I thought that this film was funny with a witchy twist. Stockard Channing did a wonderful job as the funny yet witty aunt. She was delightful. The story was romantic but twisted. The aunts gave the story a bit more comedy. They spiced it up. All in all I gave this movie an A+ just for the wonderful performances by the supporting roles.',\n",
              " \"Ok, so RotK was still wicked but it felt a bit flat. Here's why:(spoilers ahead!)They didn't build up the Witch King enough. Him vs Eowyn could have been stupendous, but they didn't give him enough PR beforehand (hello?! I'm f*****g unkillable over here! oh.. now I'm dead). Aragorn suddenly appeared in Gondorian armour without actually meeting any men from Gondor. Everyone forgot about Faramir, Eowyn and Merry after Pelennor Fields. I'm not saying they should have actually filmed the Houses of Healing scene (which is quite frankly awful), but a little closure would have been nice. In fact, the entire film left some massive holes, in favour of some expendable hobbit scenes at the end: no Saruman (major mistake); no Faramir and Eowyn love-in (sorely missed since they're two of the few characters who get enough sympathy to care about them - much more than Aragorn and Arwen!); what happened to the Orcs that didn't fall into the pit?; what the hell happened to Legolas and Gimli at the end of the film?!; no funeral for Theoden, who deserved one.The battles seemed a lot more like set-pieces than in TTT, with way less emotional involvement.. there was nothing near the TTT charge of the Rohirrim, and the only thing that came close was the.. well.. the charge of the Rohirrim. Theoden was very well done, till he got squashed without a fight. Too many CGI Oliphaunts, not enough hand-to-hand from the Gondorians. Not enough build-up to the arrival of the Haradrim ships. Shelob was a big anticlimax.Did I get everything? probably not. Frodo/Sam/Gollum was done pretty awesomely (I liked the changes they made, although I question the need for a 10 minute Smeagol flashback) and they improved the Mt Doom scene a lot from the book. The battle scenes could have been awesome too(making the rest of the film more awesome), but I think they just needed a bit more emotional oomph behind them.Having said all that, I felt a bit disappointed after seeing Two Towers, too, but it grew on me a lot. So I suppose I'll have to watch it a couple more times. Plus, the extended version has a lot more scope for improving the film than with TTT. So there is hope, even if it is just a fool's hope.Oscar chances: middling. A lot of other people (probably less fan-ish) have thought it was excellent, so it might get a big following. Sean Astin could be worthy of Supporting Actor; Elijah Wood would probably deserve a nomination for Best Actor, but I still don't like Viggo Mortensen and he'd probably get nominated for it too. Gollum was much more one-dimensional in this one so no hope for Andy Serkiss. Sir Ian was good but didn't really have to stretch himself in such a hammy role. Miranda Otto could have got a nomination for Supporting Actress on the back of TTT, but she didn't get enough screen time here. If Tyler or Blanchett get something and she doesn't, I'm gonna burn things. I think the film (and the trilogy as a whole) was very well-shot and well-written, but sadly I didn't think RotK was actually that well directed or cut (see above rant for examples) so if Peter Jackson gets Best Director I think it'll be out of respect for what he's done rather than his actual directing talent. Oh and the soundtracks have got progressively worse since the first film.Final grade (after one viewing): wicked, on a scale from pathetic to absolutely awesome . In Arabic numerals, this may equate to 8/10 (where TTT and FotR were 9)\",\n",

Ben Wishaw is great as the voice of Paddington as are Imelda Staunton and Michael Gambon as his (bear) parents. Nicole Kidman is convincing as the villain.

              " \"Spike Jonze and Charlie Kaufman. What a brilliant duo. Their films are not only excellent, extremely intelligent and wonderfully well made in all the filmmaking aspect, but also makes the term original looks banal. This, coming in an age where everything is recycled and the word originality itself is rarely used to describe films released in the last 20 years or so. But there is it. Adaptation. The subject may look a bit simple and over used, I mean, it's not really the first time that a film explores the 'Writer's block' subject. A notable example of films with the same theme is the Coen's Barton Fink. So then you ask: what makes Adaptation so unique? Well, Kaufman's imagination simply can't restrain itself to one 'main' theme. That ambition is what makes Adaptation so unique. Despite having an excellent, superb character development, the story isn't only about one character. It's about life. It talks about the concept of creating for art vs 'industry', there is all the problems of this fictional 'Kaufman', and there is even questions about themes in the literature, such as 'putting the artist in it's own work' . There is a similar idea on the book The Picture of Dorian Gray, by the great Oscar Wilde. And I'm not even in the beginning. Is a fascinating film.I don't even praised the excellent performances in the film. Cage, phenomenal. I think it's his greatest performance so far, and totally deserved an Oscar back in 2002. He was indeed great. Meryl Streep was good as always, she looked very comfortable in the role. Chris Cooper was a bit overrated, but he was good regardless. If I had to say everything that I wanted about this film I probably would spent a lot of time, but this is a quick review, so I just want to say...Watch it! 9.8/10\",\n",
              " 'Contemporary french horror seems to work like this: let\\'s rip off some already overused American horror-clich√©, add some twist, some surreal, and interesting details, and make the whole this violent as hell.The story basically about a girl who accidentally gets captured by a secret society, which tortures people. Pretty much like Hostel, yes.So what about the twists? There are some, indeed. This secret society has a strict reason behind it\\'s activity, and it\\'s not about just feeding the perverted senses of the sadist members. I wont tell you that reason, but is shakes up the plot a bit, which is unfortunately still paper-thin. The characters are flat (though the casting is great. The child actors really resemble the adults who they supposed to grow up to be), the story insists, that there is some kind of character-development (and spirituality), but i really don\\'t feel it. the whole \"endgame\", if i may call it that way, is a bit rushed, i just doesn\\'t seem very believable. And since this film is not a B-movie (it is indeed very well made), and we\\'re not in the 80\\'s anymore, I\\'d like to see a bit more over-thought details in the story also. The whole movie is VERY serious from beginning to end, and this requires a more coherent, and immersing plot.What\\'s with the original details? All the little things that makes this movie worthwhile. I like the look of the torture chamber. It\\'s not dirty, rusty, or even old (the stereotypical look you got familiar with from all the classic horror movies or even music videos). It\\'s high-tech, and clean. It\\'s makes much more sense. If anyone would decide to build one, i assume he\\'d take time and effort to make it convenient to use. I already mentioned the casting, it\\'s just great. Most of the effects are very well executed, so you can see everything in their gory details (there are some anatomic errors, but i guess most people wouldn\\'t even realize them).And the violence? Whew... This movie is brutal. Over the top brutal. As in most french horrors nowadays, the violence comes from the realistic and serious approach. The gore never gets cartoony, or comic. Even when there\\'s not that much blood, it\\'s just so mean spirited... Others pointed out, that the movie suffers from something which i\\'d like to call a \"Passion of the Christ - symptom\" it is just so insanely violent, it makes you numb after awhile. Maybe, but i didn\\'t feel that. I think the movie makers were smarter in this one, and they always managed to top each scene with an even more repulsive one. The earlier mentioned endgame is a strange exclusion, that part (though not very long), makes the movie sit down a little. All in all, Martyrs a good horror movie, even in the classic horror way, it\\'s very tense and it often made me jump. The gore is very strong also, so gore-hounds should also be pleased by it. Just keep in mind, that it\\'s not that kind of film you\\'d like to see in the middle of a fun, horror marathon. It\\'s dark, it\\'s serious, and very sad. Thanks for reading.',\n",

              " \"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (2002) suffers from many of the same flaws as the first movie: it's trying so hard to be faithful to every detail that it slows down the pacing, the child actors are awkward and stiff, and the direction is overall uninspired.However, this is undoubtedly more watchable than Sorcerer's Stone. For one thing, it has more atmosphere. Like the novel, it's Gothic and mysterious. Details such as the echo of the basilisk slithering throughout the castle, the ominous Chamber of Secrets, and the enigmatic depiction of Tom Riddle are all well-realized. The climactic battle between Harry and the basilisk still gives me chills after all this time.Luckily, Chris Columbus was outed once the producers got to the next film. They put in an accomplished director, Alfonso Cuaron, and the movie franchise was all the better for it.\",\n",

I can't believe what I'm about to write, but Heath Ledger turned out to be a better Joker than Jack Nicholson, I mean this new Joker was a total psycho, he did those things because he wanted to prove that we all act like animals when we are under pressure and Nicholson's Joker did all those things just because he wanted to, because he was the bad guy. I also liked the twist that Nolan gave to Batman, because we all have this image about superheroes: they are good, innocent guys and everything they do is right, but you really question this when the movie ends. I also didn't expect certain things to happen in the film (Rachel's death, for example)which is good, because it means that the movie is well- written. Can't wait for the next movie, I read that Joseph Gordon Levitt will be Riddler, I don't like him a lot as a villain, but I thought the same about the Joker and Nolan proved me wrong, so I'll just wait and see.\",\n",

              " \"After reading some of the mainstream critics reviews I was kind of a reluctant to go and watch the Hobbit for fear that I would be disappointed in the same way I was after watching the Dark Knight Rises. Thankfully my concerns as well as the mainstream critics negative reviews proved to have been unfounded. A complaint I keep on hearing from the critics is regarding the pacing of the film. There was absolutely nothing wrong with the pacing. For a three hour long movie not only did it succeed in keeping my attention the entire time but when it ended it didn't feel as if three hours just went by. The pacing of this film can best be compared to an action packed 90 minute movie. The flow was excellent. To give you an example, when I went to watch Breaking Dawn Part 2, I kept looking at my watch to see what time it was because that movie was just dragging on and when that movie ended it felt as if I was in the theater for 8 hours. I enjoyed the action sequences in the Hobbit. Yes, the story is simplistic but that doesn't make the movie bad. The novel is only around 350 pages but that didn't stop it from becoming a literary masterpiece. The one real issue I had with the Hobbit was regarding character development. I like the way that Jackson began introducing Dwalin, Balin, Killi and Filli in the beginning. By doing this I got to know these four characters. Sadly that can't be said for the other 8 members of dwarf company. After Killi and Filli were introduced, Jackson decided to forgo further introductions and just brought the rest of the group into Bilbo's home. The consequence of this action is by the end of the movie I still didn't get to know the other dwarfs which was sad. In fact, for the rest of the movie, the other dwarfs rarely speak with the exception of Ori. Bombur was a funny character but he had maybe 5-6 lines in the whole movie. To me the other dwarfs just felt irrelevant. I am hoping in the next two films, Jackson will take more care and let us get to know the other wonderful characters in this story. Aside from this issue I felt this movie was a masterpiece. In my opinion I feel that the negative critiques from the mainstream critics is more political than anything. Look at the disparity between the critics and the average moviegoers. The critics give the film around a 48% while the average moviegoers (who are the people who actually matter) give the film a 90%. Normally the disparity between the two groups is closers. Check out the reviews for Breaking Dawn Part 2 and you see that the reviews of the critics and the audience is fairly even 54% and 56% respectfully.\",\n",

              " 'After emerging in the 1990s and early 2000s as one of the top horror directors thanks to films like 1999\\'s \\'The Sixth Sense\\' and 2000\\'s \\'Unbreakable\\', it\\'s no secret that M. Night Shyamalan\\'s career began to experience an unfortunate downward spiral starting with 2002\\'s \\'Signs\\' leading up to the truly irredeemable 2008\\'s \\'The Happening\\'. Even when he try to film, other genre like 2010\\'s \\'The Last Airbender\\' & 2013\\'s \\'After Earth\\', he continue to fail to connect with his audience. However, in 2015, it all change as he return to form with \\'The Visit\\'. That movie became a surprise hit with critics and horror fans. It even show the first signs of a possible comeback. With that reconnected with his audience, Shyamalan released his newest stylish psychological thriller \\'Split\\' about three girls: Claire (Haley Lu Richardson), Marcia (Jessica Sula) and Casey (Anya Taylor Joy) being kidnapped by a mysterious man (James McAvoy) whom been diagnosed 23 distinct personalities; as they must try to escape before the man\\'s deadly 24 persona takes hold. Like \\'The Visit\\', a few years earlier, \\'Split\\' mostly received generally positive reviews from both audiences and critics. For me, personally, I thought it was one of his very best written film yet, even if two of the three victims are thinly-thought of. At least, the third, Casey, is given a semblance of multidimensionality via a series of flashbacks that plays a big part in the climax of the film. Anya Taylor Joy does a great job, showing us, the quiet and raw emotion that not many other actresses her age are capable of. We wanted to see her, survive against the mental disturb man. The movie did portray a very good, Hitchcockism \\'Psycho\\' mysterious-like vibe with the mysterious villain, ranging from the OCD neat freak, to an innocent child-like being to a creepy motherly figure. Mad props goes to James McAvoy for making a haunting man with 23 personalities seem somewhat real, even if we only see 7th of them. Still, I like how each one of them, has its own strengths, physical traits and flaws. I also like how each one has with its own unique ways of managing Kevin\\'s fears and protecting him from the world around him. It also amazing to see some of the personas impersonates others, during the explosion dumps scenes, such as the ones, he has, with psychiatrist, Dr. Karen Fletcher (Betty Buckley). Nearly every dialogue having some subtle mysterious purpose, foreshadowing to what is to come. While, some people still hate the movie for how it portrayed, dissociative identity disorder. In my opinion, the psychological aspects of dissociative identity disorder are presented accurately to how they appear in medical literature with diagnosis often being difficult, as there is considerable comorbidity with other mental disorders, and malingering often happens. While, it\\'s true that most people suffering from \\'DID\\', are more of a danger to themselves, than to other people. I do have to say, there are \\'DID\" people like this, who trick and hide the pain from others. Even with cameo of Shyamalan, these scenes, along with Mike Gioulakis\\'s cinematography with the sinister, windowless, underground lair, smoothly snaking with corridors, dingy doors and pipes, and harsh pools of light, adds to the suspense that already full of physical dangers to the girls, whom trying to escape through structural weaknesses or trying outsmart their deranged captor. What follows is a cat-and-mouse game of epic, psychological proportions, packed to the brim with a few surprises and more than a few unexpected twists and turns. One of them, like the supernatural powers might seem a little too out of this world, but it does come from real-world theories about the elastic limits of human possibility. While the supernatural subplot seem to come out of nowhere for the viewer that wasn\\'t paying attention. There were some great subtle foreshadowing of that, within the movie. A good example is the scene where one of the persona has to take insulin shots. Who knows, if that was for the diabetes or to help with having extreme abilities like super strength like a shot of steroids!? Another, would be the sight of the mysterious man, mourning his father, disappearance at the train station. Could his father, be one of the victims of Eastrail 177 crash!? All of this, could be, possible, as the film concept for this flick was originally written for a different, previous movie of Shyamalan. So, don\\'t be, too surprised of the twist, toward the end, at the diner. Overall: I will say that if you\\'re a stickler for realism, you might want to save yourself the frustration. While not perfect, with the help of his actors and technical crew, Shyamalan has created a film that feels less like a standard horror kidnapping tale, and more like a legitimately moving story about self-discovery. This is a smart movie that will undoubtedly leave viewers thinking -- and discussing. If you have enjoyed any of M. Night\\'s smart movie before, then there is a good chance you will enjoy this horror flick. Highly recommended.',\n",

But it\\'s your actions that dictate that. Him just going out, saving the little girl and even his own dog from the tornado despite losing his own life, can be an inspiration for all people. It doesn\\'t require muscles and big abs and pecs like Henry Cavill to be a superhero/superman. Its your action and willingness, which \"Pa\" Kent demonstrated. Anyways, really great film.

The sheer frequency of these films and the existing knowledge that they're not going to kill any of the characters off because they need them for ensemble films is common at this point, so there are no major stakes.Also, after thirteen films in the MCU where they have more or less fleshed out the majority of these superheroes, suddenly now we're being introduced to a fresh face? Just a tad jarring. The introduction to Benedict Cumberbatch as Doctor Strange is nothing we aren't used to. Typical fall from grace and redemption story.The cast are all respected thespians in their own right, but there are no Oscar worthy scenes here. Well, in terms of acting, anyway. The CGI, absolutely.

              " 'No one could ever expect a cinematic representation of historical events to be completely objective - film is an indisputably subjective medium, and the \\'voice\\' of the director and producers are bound to always shine through. But objectivity is one thing, and Oliver Stone is its polar opposite. Instead of Stone\\'s powerhouse film-making style and fierce political convictions adding substance and energy to JFK, his take on the infamous assassination and its aftermath, it is Stone\\'s self-righteous and self-indulgent hammering of the material that inhibit the film from being the intelligent and compelling political investigation piece it could have been. As it is, while JFK could be considered a solid thesis on Stone\\'s perspective on the events, as a film it struggles to hold up amidst the torrent of its own flaws. Stone may never have had the pretense of disguising his perception of the events of the JFK assassination and the alleged ensuing conspiracy as cold hard fact, but he certainly seems determined to beat his audience over the head with his side of the story to the point of bewildered acceptance. Stone\\'s incredibly forceful portrayal of his own perspective, pitching his film directly to heartfelt American sentiment (even going so far as to have Costner directly address the camera when speaking of American liberty) has the final outcome emerge as just a shade away from propaganda. Stone\\'s work tends to attract a \"love it or hate it\" reaction, but with a film this shamelessly self-congratulating and painfully biased, it is distinctly hard to love it, plaudits or not. Apart from Stone\\'s own stance on the material, speaking strictly in film-making terms, JFK also finds itself lacking. Excruciatingly long and unreasonably \"talky\" (especially near the film\\'s climax, where Kevin Costner talks for literally half an hour straight... no joke) and making use of an abundance of unreasonably clich√©d patriotic sequences enough to make one\\'s stomach queasy, Stone\\'s film is far too self-indulgent to make its proper effect. Seldom arises the complaint that a director needs to simplify their work, but given the relatively simple plot ensuing, Stone sure manages to complicate the hell out of it, clarified with a series of incredibly contrived play-by-plays by Garrison and his team. While it is abundantly clear that Stone has done his research on the case, and it is easy to get swept up in the story to a degree, one can\\'t help but wish that he had not found it necessary to include every last scrap of information regarding it - as such, the film feels like it is overflowing at the seams with factual information, often thrust so rapid fire into the audience\\'s face that they have no time to process or internalize it. It is a shame indeed that the content of the film is so disappointingly brought to life, as JFK\\'s technical work is laudable indeed, making use of terrific cinematography and editing (although the initially effective montage sequences, complimented with real historical footage do grow tiresome after being steadily overused as the film progresses) even if the normally reliable John Williams\\' score overloads on patriotic musical clich√©s to a nauseating extent. The astonishing array of talented actors substantially raise the quality of the film as a whole. While Kevin Costner as patriotic American everyman DA Jim Garrison is bland at best, painfully trite at worst and unquestionably given far too much screen time, the wonderful supporting cast are more than enough to carry the dead weight of the film\\'s lead. Tommy Lee Jones, in a distinctly different role from his usual casting is electrifying as ominous influential businessman Clay Shaw, with a cold menace simmering beneath his character\\'s flamboyant exterior. Gary Oldman of course effortlessly steals the show as alleged assassin Lee Harvey Oswald - seen mostly in flashbacks, Oldman\\'s meticulous dedication in fully inhabiting his characters is used to chilling and compelling effect. Backed by dynamic performances from Joe Pesci, Donald Sutherland, Kevin Bacon, Jack Lemmon, John Candy and Walter Matthau, all superb when given their moment to shine, the film\\'s supporting cast raises the bar in terms of quality considerably. Unfortunately, Sissy Spacek is wasted in a banal subplot as Garrison\\'s wife, adding a nauseatingly by the numbers \"obsession endangers family life\" theme to an already overlong film. As Stone dollops on the sap and Spacek overacts to her heart\\'s content, backed up by absurdly untalented child actors as their children, the family sequences are among the film\\'s most painful and unnecessary. Keeping in mind that appreciation of Oliver Stone\\'s films does tend to be just as subjective as his own cinematic stance, it becomes difficult to dispute JFK being far too overlong, overstuffed with dialogue and bombarded by offensively clich√©d sequences to be anywhere near as effective as it ought to have been. While intriguing in its presentation of a distinctly one sided rumination on the events following the assassination and complimented with brilliant technical work and impressive performances from its supporting cast, Stone\\'s distinctive slant is what drags the film down from being the taut political work it could have been, resulting in a fact bloated, lopsided and self-indulgent portrayal of American history.-5/10',\n",

Therefore, the entire film is about cheating, half-truths and seduction rather than romance. Lou\\'s shallow character archetype of the \"quirky\" girl in bright tights serves only to reinforce the idea that she is naive and selfish. After being in a relationship for 6 years with her bf, - who at this point trusts Lou\\'s support in his fitness dreams - Lou suddenly drops it all for a hidden love affair with a \"broken\" heart throb. The birthday scene alone was so unbelievable that she would pay so much attention to this mysterious man rather than her boyfriend across the table that it left me wandering how come no one warned her about what she was doing. Oh yes, her sister talked to her about it...but suggested arranging lap dances for her patient instead?! Doesn\\'t her sister know she is already attached to her boyfriend Patrick? What lousy advice there!No more than 20 minutes into the movie, every romantic scene turned into a scene of betrayal and hidden intentions. The book may have gone into more detail regarding exactly how much of a douche Lou\\'s boyfriend Patrick really was, but this movie glazed over it so superficially that I ended up feeling sorry for the poor guy. He did not even lose his temper or have a big dramatic scene.

Toss in the psychic woman, the gadgets to capture changes in temperature and you have the usual set pieces. Influences are very obvious but never directly copied as Insidious definitely makes its own stamp in the haunted house movie genre.

I have seen a lot of Clint Eastwood\\'s movies in the past such as \"Invictus\", \"Letters of Iwo Jima\", \"The Good, The Bad and The Ugly\", \"Gran Torino\" and so on... \"Million Dollar Baby\" is right at the top; Indeed, Mrs Swank, Mr Freeman and Mr Eastwood are spectacular. Their performances are outstanding through the entire movie and the story of this masterpiece is greatly inspiring. Before watching it, I was expecting another \"boxing movie\" but it was all but boxing. Of course, boxing is present however, the main plot is the relationship between Hilary Swank, Clint Eastwood and Morgan Freeman. Anyone who will see this film will be shocked, amazed and inspired. \"Million Dollar Baby\" it is not only a \"must-see\" movie but a \"must-see\" Masterpiece. I firmly believe this movie is able to touch you in unique ways and I would recommend this movie to everybody. Great actors\\' performances, great music, great cameras\\' angles, great and epic scenes and amazing plot.',\n",
              " \"Finally, at long last, we have a worthy sequel to the Jurassic Park series! 22 years have passed since the events of the first film. The island of dinosaurs has continued thriving in a newer, bigger, better park called Jurassic World. The park's geneticists have made breakthroughs including gene-splicing and hybrid engineering. They've recently created a new attraction, a cross-bred carnivore called the Indominus Rex. However, the park's owners have been experiencing problems with the new dinosaur and it's paddock. One thing leads to another, and before you know it, the I-Rex escapes wreaking havoc on the tasty wildlife and people. In the lead is Chris Pratt as former-Navy turned game warden. He's completely awesome and shows that real men still wear mustaches! Beside him for most of the film is Clare (Bryce Dallas Howard) picking up the reigns from where John Hammond left off. Clare's two nephews Gray (Ty Simpkins) and Zach (Nick Robinson) also happen to be in the park when the rampage begins. The series has always had good solid acting, even if the characters in 2 and 3 were (annoying, paper thin, crunchable, etc.) This time around, the filmmakers wisely avoided having any of those types.So now, everyone's on a race to stop the I-Rex, save the visitors, and rescue Jurassic World from permanent foreclosure! As I already stated, this is a worthy sequel. From the writing to the cinematography to the music and characterizations, everything works beautifully. You'll be at turns thrilled, chilled, saddened, and have your heart warmed again! Welcome back to the park!!!\",\n",

The film had all the elements of a fun successful family film: witty dialogue, enticing action scenes, charming cast, and a message of moral character. It was an entertaining film that kept me and my guest captivated; we laughed, winced, and rooted for D'artagnan and the Musketeers. The crowd in the theater seemed to have the same experience as I did, eruptions of laughter filled the cinema and upon leaving the theater overheard good feedback from the film. The majority of the audience comprised of families. I spoke to my best friend in New York who had also gone out to see the film with her friends on opening night and she thoroughly enjoyed it and said that the audience seemed to really like it as well. I have to admit though that there was not much that I heard about the movie. In the last month or so the only advertising I had seen on 3M was a billboard by my house and 2 commercials. This is also something I've been hearing from a lot of people that they just did not know the film was coming out.

Idiotic comedy about man's competitive nature as step-dad Brad Whitaker, played by Will Ferrell desires to be accepted by his step-kids but when biological father Dusty Mayron, played by Mark Wahlberg, returns a predictable back and forth unfunny prat falls follows as one struggles to out do the other. Formula driven plot with a dance off climax that is as lame as they get. Sean Anders has directed better comedies in Horrible Bosses 2 and Sex Drive, which are both underrated but here even the production seems routine and uninspiring. Ferrell as Brad is his usual self in his loud payoff but the character can be identified with and Ferrell is a trooper even when accidentally electrocuted. Wahlberg as Dusty shows up on a motorcycle brandishing black leather and intimidation. Linda Cardellini as Ferrell's wife caught between the two is nothing more than a prop to be jerked back and forth. She wants a third child and obviously Dusty will attempt to fulfil that. Thomas Hayden Church as Brad's boss at the radio station is another cardboard role best forgotten. Hannibal Buress is the one supporting characters that brings a few chuckles as a black construction worker sheltered in Brad's home because of a racial situation urged on by Dusty. The message regards being a good father or step-father and coming to some sort of truce. Either way when daddy gets home, something better has to be playing on TV. Score: 4 ¬Ω / 10\",\n",

The three main characters, Damon, Stefan and Elena are the one\\'s to blame for my obsession with The Vampire Diaries. I believe that in order for something to be considered \"good,\" the characters have to draw you in. You have to be attached to the leads and your eyes should be glued to them when they are on screen. With Damon\\'s sassy, bad boy approach and Stefan\\'s innocent, yet brooding approach (not to mention it isn\\'t bad on the eyes\\x85), I can guarantee you will fall in love with these characters. Elena has this innocent glow about her and she leaves you wanting to be involved in their twisted lifestyle. Although it is a show about vampire\\'s attacking a plethora of creatures (human or non-human), the show goes about it in a way that doesn\\'t make you want to laugh at the TV and make fun of the plot line (unless you\\'re laughing at Damon\\'s egotistical remarks\\x85which is very likely). Nevertheless, you\\'re left with these feelings of love, anger, happiness, sadness and curiosity.

Being a romantic at heart, I was emotionally drawn to this well produced and entertaining motion picture, enticing me to view it a number of times more.Some friends have indicated that the \"plot\" is boring and in 2 hours and 4 minutes takes too long to come to an expected conclusion. But the lyrical chemistry between William Thacker (Hugh Grant) and Anna Scott (Julia Roberts) give intimate glimpses into the human heart and spirit. As in Mary Poppins when Burt jumps into the chalk sidewalk drawing, I longed to join this tapestry of two people falling in love, among caring friends and relatives. To longingly look into Anna\\'s eyes and to see a reflection of your very own soul of hope and humanity may seem less than exciting to some people.....too involved in their fast paced, action world and who fail to see the beauty of life around them....to smell the roses.Watching the inflections of Julia Robert\\'s face became a mesmerizing cinema experience. And Hugh Grant\\'s thoughtful and honest, yet quirky presence gave hope to what could be possible. Then wrap all this with a humorous, loving and insightful group of friends and family......WOW!After watching \"Notting Hill\" with my wife and giving her a big hug, I saw that she was just a girl, standing in front of a boy, wanting to be loved!What greater joy of meaning can be given by a film?\"Teach me the Magic of Wonder, Give me the Spirit to Fly\" - John Denver',\n",

The whole point of Soze going after the guy on the ship, and thus the point of the film, is to protect his identity, \"the one guy who could identify him\". However, at the end of the movie, not only does one person know his identity but the police have a sketch and full description of him. He\\'s much worse off at the end of the movie for all his efforts. Yet the closing remarks of \"and like the devil he was gone\" or something to that effect makes it sound like everything has gone as he had planned. It\\'s true he may not be aware that the police have this information on him, maybe it was set up for a possible sequel where the police attempt to apprehend him. Trouble is this failing to cover up his identity takes away from him mystique of being this ultra-cool untouchable underworld figure, he\\'s failed to accomplish his main aim.Having said that the film has great performances from Kevin Spacey and Benicio Del Toro (who oddly isn\\'t given credit on the cover of my DVD edition).

I 1st saw it on late-nite TV, as a 'kid', and was quickly 'hooked'---no idea of who Kubrick was---simply captivated by the acting, realism, and sad truths of the politics of war.Kirk Douglas is superb, as the defender of French soldiers, who wisely refuse to be 'cannon-fodder', later accused of 'desertion', only to be put on trial, for their lives.The film, for some reason, was handed to Kubrick and this is where he became known as 'Master-of-the-trenches', having several close-calls at being 'blown-up' while directing the many very chancy explosions characteristic of 'trench-warfare'. Unlike his later work, there is no dark humor here---just brutal reportage, as in 'The Killers'.This film never flinches in its realism. The hapless 'deserters, to spite a brilliant defense, have no chance---it's a 'set-up' from the 'get-go'.Seeing this work truly informs the viewer of war's injustices, and dispensed any foolish ideas of my youth on its 'glory'. The final scene, (spoiler?), where one to be shot passes-out, only to have the executioner slap him awake haunts me even now. A Must-See.\",\n",
              " 'Ridley Scott\\'s American Gangster is not only a hard-hitting expos√© of a Harlem crime lord who outwitted the Mafia and gained control of the drug trade, but a revelation of the unholy alliance that existed between drug traffickers, corrupt police officers, and big business elites in New York during the late 1960s. Denzel Washington is Frank Lucas, a heroin dealer and organized crime boss who made millions selling drugs on the streets of New York. Successful in minimizing the power of Italian distributors who controlled Harlem by eliminating the middleman and buying heroin directly from a Southeast Asian source, Lucas\\' operation was, in the words of Sterling Johnson, a narcotics prosecutor in New York, \"one of the most outrageous international dope-smuggling gangs ever.\" Frank began his career as the associate of Ellsworth \"Bumpy\" Johnson (Clarence Williams III), one of the leading figures in organized crime in the early 20th century and an enforcer who protected the Harlem interests of the Italian Mafia. As the film opens, Bumpy and Lucas enter a discount appliance store where Bumpy tells Frank of his dismay at the disappearance in America of \"pride of ownership\", \"personal service\", and the loss of the middle man in the sales process. After Bumpy\\'s sudden death, Lucas attempts to build his own operation and undercut the Mafia\\'s monopoly on the drug business by going directly to the source.Traveling to Southeast Asia during the Vietnam War, Lucas concludes an exclusive arrangement to obtain 100 percent pure heroin which he sells on the streets as \"Blue Magic\", only 10 percent pure. Lucas operates under the radar, smuggling the dope into the States on military planes and bringing family members such as Huey Lucas (Chiwetel Ejiofor) from North Carolina to set up storefront businesses scattered throughout the New York/New Jersey area that serve as distribution centers. A determined enforcer, he is also seen as a suave businessman making arrangements with Mafia bosses and confronting his rival Nicky Barnes (Cuba Gooding, Jr.,) about infringement of his trademark use of the name Blue Magic.In a superb performance as the opportunistic crime lord, Washington projects a low-profile surface veneer of sophistication that covers up an explosive brutality. He refuses to dress ostentatiously, goes to church every Sunday with his mother (Ruby Dee) and is generous to his Puerto Rican wife Eva (Lymari Nadal) but will turn on a family member instantly if his security is jeopardized in any way. Lucas has no problem dealing with New York\\'s anti-drug Special Investigations Unit, paying off the majority of its members, in particular Detective Trupo (Josh Brolin). What he doesn\\'t count on, however, is an honest cop like detective Richie Roberts played by the outstanding Russell Crowe. Roberts, whose personal life borders on chaos, has become an outcast in his own department after turning in a million dollars in cash that he found in the trunk of a car because it was \"the right thing to do\".The relationship between Roberts and Lucas is the highlight of the film and their face to face \"negotiation\" near the end of the film is reminiscent of the meeting between De Niro and Pacino in Michael Mann\\'s Heat. American Gangster is solid entertainment that is primarily a character study of two men on opposite sides who are determined to put their lives together, one to the benefit of society, the other to its detriment.The strongest aspect of the film, however, is its courage in exposing the web of corruption that existed in the police force at the time. In one scene, Roberts tells his fellow officers about how hard it is for him to gain cooperation from federal agencies. \"I don\\'t think they want this to stop\", he says. \"Judges, lawyers, cops, politicians, they stop bringing dope into this country, about a hundred thousand people are gonna be out of a job.\" In a trenchant commentary on the values in society, by 1977, 52 out of 70 officers who worked in the Special Investigations Unit were either in jail or under indictment.\"',\n",
              " 'Any comic-book fan would agree if I say that for us the main purpose of making a film adaptation of a Comic title is the chance to (finally) share with the whole world the magic and excitement that we know so well already. That\\'s why some of the hard-core comic fans tend to be so vocal about an extreme radical departure from the source material. \"If it isn\\'t broke, don\\'t fix it\". And while I admit that giving Spider-man organic web-shooters was a big improvement on the character, I must also say that it was somewhat disappointing to me to see the movie portrayal of the Fantastic Four. For instance, MARVEL\\'s greatest villain is Dr. Doom. A character some consider to be one (if not the main) influence to create the character of Darth Vader (from Star Wars) who is only cinema\\'s greatest villain. Did you know that? So it is sad to see such a scarce development of the Dr. Doom character that I can\\'t help but wondering if it was a serious attempt of telling the broad audience the potential of comic\\'s first super-hero team / dysfunctional family or just making a movie for the sake of it. I mean, \"The Incredibles\" was a better Fantastic Four movie than this ever was! And we\\'re not discussing visual effects or casting\\x85O.k., we could discuss casting, Michael Chilkis notwithstanding, but the point is that a great opportunity was lost in this film to channel some of the greatest comic stories ever told. At certain point I even considered the possibility of a FF movie to be a period movie, set in the 60\\'s that as a matter of fact were the years when the comics were the hot new trend, or so was I told, but then again I recently stumbled with the work of such great contemporary authors as Brian Michael Bendis, Warren Ellis and Mark Millar on the current comics and I saw how you can successfully update an old and established concept for the 21st century. Once you read their work you will clearly understand my frustration with this film. Is it bad? No it\\'s not. Is it Fantastic? Far from it.',\n",

              " 'It is a strange comment to make about a film set inside a prison, but \"The Shawshank Redemption\" creates a warm hold on our feelings because it makes us a member of a family. Many movies offer us vicarious experiences and quick, superficial emotions. \"Shawshank\" slows down and looks. It uses the narrator\\'s calm, observant voice to include us in the story of men who have formed a community behind bars. It is deeper than most films; about continuity in a lifetime, based on friendship and hope.Interesting that although the hero of the film is the convicted former banker Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), the action is never seen from his point of view. The film\\'s opening scene shows him being given two life sentences for the murder of his wife and her lover, and then we move, permanently, to a point of view representing the prison population and particularly the lifer Ellis \\'Red\\' Redding (Morgan Freeman). It is his voice remembering the first time he saw Andy (\"looked like a stiff breeze would blow him over\"), and predicting, wrongly, that he wouldn\\'t make it in prison.From Andy\\'s arrival on the prison bus to the film\\'s end, we see only how others see him - Red, who becomes his best friend, Brooks the old librarian, the corrupt Warden Norton, guards and prisoners. Red is our surrogate. He\\'s the one we identify with, and the redemption, when it comes, is Red\\'s. We\\'ve been shown by Andy\\'s example that you have to keep true to yourself, not lose hope, bide your time, set a quiet example and look for your chance. \"I guess it comes down to a simple choice, really,\" he tells Red. \"Get busy living\\' or get busy dying\\'.\"The key to the film\\'s structure, I think, is that it\\'s not about its hero, but about our relationship with him - our curiosity, our pity, our admiration. If Andy had been the heroic center, bravely enduring, the film would have been conventional, and less mysterious. But we wonder about this guy. Did he really kill those two people? Why does he keep so much to himself? Why can he amble through the prison yard like a free man on a stroll, when everyone else plods or sidles?People like excitement at the movies, and titles that provide it do well. Films about \"redemption\" are approached with great wariness; a lot of people are not thrilled by the prospect of a great film - it sounds like work. But there\\'s a hunger for messages of hope, and when a film offers one, it\\'s likely to have staying power even if it doesn\\'t grab an immediate audience.',\n",

Of course by watching the trailer I expected a high tech, sfx and enjoyable laid back consumers experience, but the story itself is quite smart and complicated and until the plot was completely revealed, I did not know whodunit. The acting itself is good, as you would expect from these A class actors. The chemistry is there between all four of the magicians, between Mark Ruffalo and Melanie Laurent (yes, that's her from Tarantino's Inglorious Bastards) and between Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman. It is nice to see the two last ones performing as not really friendly characters, and Mark Ruffalo as an asshole. Castingwise this movie hits bullseye on all fronts. After the introduction of the four magicians, we step into a roller coaster of special effects and illusions while the police is trying to catch them and they always have to be some steps ahead. And they are. That much you can get from the trailer. Watching the movie it makes me break my brain on how they do everything. It is so witty and smart that I can't help myself having a lot of huh?-moments during the movie. But of course, without spoiling the plot to you, most of it will be revealed at the end.

Lewis\\' classic Christian fantasy about four British siblings who wander into an enchanted realm and of a boys\\' redemption through the sacrifice of a noble lion had been long contested prior to this film. Disney had always intended to produce this fantasy film but never did. Finally, in 2005 Walden Media Productions and director Andrew Adamson released this terrific and awe-inspiring movie, which, unlike many book-to-film adaptations, is faithful and stunning. Georgie Henley, William Moseley, Skandar Keynes and Anna Popplewell star as the Pevensie children Edmund, Lucy, Peter and Susan who during the 1940 Blitzkrieg over London are temporarily secluded in eccentric and affluent Professor Kirke\\'s (Jim Broadbent) sprawling mansion. Lucy discovers a winter wonderland behind a closet/wardrobe and soon Peter discovers the same thing. But this enchanted world is under a dark spell..\"It\\'s always winter, but never Christmas\". The wicked White Witch (Tilda Swinton) is contesting the right to rule the world and fighting a battle against the rightful king, the good lion Aslan. True to the novel in every aspect, this film is enjoyable as a fantasy for adults and for children. It is a long film and in fact December of \\'05 saw many long films including Harry Potter and King Kong. But you hardly feel the time go by as we journey into the heart of Narnia with the children. Peter learns a valuable lesson in love and sacrifice as Aslan offers to die in his place for his betrayal. Now, everyone who is deeply familiar with C.S. Lewis\\'works understand that this is a Christian allegory/fantasy. Lewis, a born-again Christian, created a Christ-like figure in Aslan, a sort of haphazard Judas in Peter, and a pagan Devil-Goddess in the WhiteWitch, though some would have it that he was attacking what we call the Goddess today. The children carry the film for the most part, despite the fact that this film relies heavily on computer-generated characters such as the Witch\\'s wolves and the helpful beavers and other good-natured animals. The scenery is gorgeous. This film was shot in various location- the UK and New Zealand and studios. Some of what we see is pure computer animation, though by today\\'s sophisticated standards, one hardly notices it and takes it for reality. The film wraps up nicely but mind you, the Narnia novels are a long series and there is already a sequel under way- Prince Caspian, said to be released in 2007.',\n",

I really liked how this movie emphasises the Fitzgerald's idea that nobody is perfect, no matter how rich or poor.Now, if you have read the book, it's like adding pictures to it, voices, faces, depicting the most meaningful chapters of the book (not all though).If Baz Luhrmann's 'Romeo + Juliet' is making you doubt whether you want to see 'The Great Gatsby', this time he did a much better job recreating the original motive of the book.\",\n",

In Gone Girl the husband Nick Dunne, for all of his wife\\'s psychotic faults, also gradually realizes that his life has benefits because he is with her, because of who they are together. Though they do not at first realize this. She, Amy Dunne, gives the very interesting \"cool girl\" speech about halfway through the film of how she had failed in trying to live up to what she thought was her husbands image of the perfect partner, which her husband Nick later echoes about himself in his one successful media interview. In their marriage, each had been trying to be that \"cool girl\" to the other. For many people, trying to live up to the right kind of ideal may in fact help them to become better people. But not so the Macbeths, nor the Dunnes. People die, former victims suffer injustices, all the while he and his wife gradually ascend to become the king and queen of the media.One of the things that makes the Shakespearean plays so satisfying is the sense of justice resolved. That doesn\\'t really happen in this film which is why I have only given it six stars out of ten. The film feels incomplete, and it would have been interesting to see their arrest, or at least a gradual unraveling under the wight of conscience--again harking back to the first couple Macbeth.The psychological aspects of the story were good, the actors were great I have to say. However, as other reviewers have noted there are many inconsistencies in the police investigation. For example, apart from those previously mentioned, why wasn\\'t the diary and ink tested for its actual age, and the security footage at the lake house of her supposed kidnapper would surely have had a number of discrepancies, particularly her relaxed arrival.

Like all things successful, Hollywood likes to get in the game, so it's no surprise that a film has been made of the first of the Percy Jackson books, The Lightning Thief. The film, Percy Jackson and the Olympians - The Lightning Thief, seems to have lost something in the translation, winding up as a film that really only shares the name of the book and nothing else.The story of the film follows teen Percy Jackson, who has absent father syndrome. He has never known his biological father and harnesses deep bitterness toward the man who forced him and his mom to live with his demeaning stepfather, Gabe. Then, one day Percy's substitute teacher, Ms. Dodds, transforms into a gigantic winged beast and attacks him whilst on a field trip, to be saved by his best friend and silent guardian, Grover (who turns out to be half human-half goat), and his teacher, Mr. Brunner (who is really hero trainer and centaur, Chiron from Greek mythology). Percy learns that he is a demigod (half human-half God), and that his father is Poseidon, God of the Sea. But trouble is afoot for Percy, because Zeus's lightning bolt has been stolen and Percy is the prime suspect in the midst of a feud between brothers existing long before he was born. Now Percy must prove his innocence if he wishes to keep the world from being engulfed in an all out war between the Gods.This film just seemed to lack any of the charm that can be found within the book. Screenwriter Craig Titley, did not have a very good handle on these characters. Percy was the smartest of his ring of friends, and not his super smart friend, Annabeth (who happens to be daughter of Athena, God of Wisdom, is there anything wrong with her being portrayed as witless and stupid?). Now, I never consider myself a book purist, I understand things must be amended in order for the book to work as a film, but this adaptation was just all over the place. They changed and cut things that should have been left in, I mean, they cut out the main villain of the entire series in this film, Kronos. Without Kronos in this first film, how can they possibly hope to make any sequels and have them make even a lick of sense? Director Chris Columbus was the man who brought the first two Harry Potter films to the screen, he knows how to create pure movie magic, but something just wasn't clicking with this film. The film flew at a breakneck pace, never taking any time to breath and let you drink in this fantastic world. Like when Percy believes that his mother has died, he's told his mother's dead, then two seconds later he's up on his feet with a smile on his face. Not to mention, the film dispersed major plot points as if they were just reading statistics off of a teleprompter, making me wonder if someone who hasn't read the book will even be able to follow this movie, or if they will even care when it's all said and done.As it is, I will not lie and say I didn't enjoy it when Percy and his friends battled the Hydra, or when they got trapped in this hotel & casino in Las Vegas that drugs you with sweet Lotus flowers to where you never want to leave, but these few moments were not enough to redeem this film. Percy Jackson and the Olympians - The Lightning Thief, is a mind-numbingly raw experience from start to finish.I give Percy Jackson and the Olympians - The Lightning Thief a 4 out of 10!\",\n",
              " \"The movie has very interesting and moving theme and is very well made. I really enjoyed the lost-and-found father of Benjamin and his father, the lost-and-found love of Benjamin and Daisy and even the stepmother's love.In the beginning I was a little bored because it seemed to me the movie would turn a cheap comedy or worse soap opera movie but I was absolutely wrong.The horde of simple themes connected together in such a light and touching way made me become Benjamin.I enjoyed the true mother love he was given by a totally strange woman. I really felt very strange being a child in an adult body and I really wished to be useful. And so I underwent all the adventures on the sea, the public house visits. (Enough the story-line.) The second thing I truly fancy about the film are the actors' starrings. Mr. Pitt is really good actor and shows again and again he can handle a lot of roles not looking strange and unnatural, he was just the opposite.Also Mrs. Blanchett poetric acting and almost higher sphere's apparel made the film just something better than the average films.Anyway, there was one thing that spilled my impression and it was the unnatural body change of Benjamin. In the beginning it was fine, but when he was old and started becoming smaller and smaller, I didn't believe something like that could be ever possible (and yet don't believe so). I would rather appreciate him staying big and just getting the childisher and child-liker look. This way it looked like a fantasy to me and didn't fit the whole story line.There's another thing I want to write about and its the similarity with Forrest Gump. I didn't find any, actually. Maybe there were some moments you can see something similar, but you have to try really hard. I saw the movie before reading any review on it and not being told about the Forrest I would never think of similarities there.I enjoyed it really much and sincerely advise everyone to try it and enjoy it.\",\n",

But this time the world setting gets to feel more victorian, steampunk and technological besides being magical. The story floats in and out of contrasting conflicts, another signature of Japanese anime aimed at various age groups. Yet I don't like how the movie keeps changing Sophie's age back and forth without any clear explanation. The story also ends quite abruptly with the background conflict of the war just ceasing out unclear. The voice acting on the Japanese version is a standard Japanese work with less dramatic voice acting yet with more quirky voice timbres.\",\n",
              " 'Sci-fi movies often deals with the theme of survival. Humans in a strange and hostile environment that they are trying to adapt to while they are facing some sort of predatorian enemy. The underlying fear that these stories work around is probably that if we one day will meet intelligent life in outer space what kind of encounter can we then expect? There are many ways to answer this question as we have seen in \"Close encounters of the third kind\", \"Contact\", \"Pitch Black\", \"Stargate\", \"Doom\", \"2001: A Space Odyssey\" and \"Starship Troopers\" to mention a few.In \"Alien\" we follow the crew on board the cargo vessel \"Nostromo\" as they are returning to Earth with ore. They pick up what at first seems to be an SOS from a planet that they pass. They send out a rescue team and from here on it\\'s a matter of survival.Many elements come well together in this film; the characters are very well developed and the atmosphere of claustrophobia and desperation is being portrayed with great skill. As others have pointed out the score is truly unique.The scene where Dallas (Tom Skerrit) dies is in my opinion the one that frightens me the most. He gets into the air-shaft with a flame-thrower in order to chase the alien. The movement-sensors that they use to track the Alien malfunctions and his anxiety, in a very convincing way, slowly gets the best of him until the point where his brain is \"emotionel hijacked\" and he makes a very irrational and fatal move. This scene alone makes the whole movie worth your while.I saw it again the other day and was a little disappointed in what I would call some minor flaws; That the alien is able to get into the ship is a very unlikely event as I see it. Even though the rescue mission passes quarantine after returning then it is still unbelievable that the crew doesn\\'t detect the alien in Kanes stomach. And the death of Brett is, although the suspense builds up extremely well in this particular instance, still hard to accept as he does the worst thing imaginable; walks alone back to get the cat.Besides these minor flaws, that none the less irritated me as I would have liked the movie to be flawless, there is nothing I can put my finger on. One thing that makes this film stand out is the pace that it is told in. It is slower than expected but this doesn\\'t make it a boring movie but instead it allows you both to engage yourself in the various details and last but not least it makes all the difference in building up the before mentioned atmosphere.I would most certainly recommended this movie if the genre in any way appeals to you.Regards Simon',\n",

The plot has some holes, but not that big, and there is a lacking of action scenes, the kind of thrilling we saw in the previous three films.Well, this is the story of Wolverine origins, and honestly, when I first heard that they were going to make this movie, this is what I expected. In the absence of other characters that made the first three parts great, this one didn't have that much chance.The reason I'm giving this movie this high grade is because of Hugh Jackman. As I mentioned in the title, he did another excellent performance as Logan/Wolverine. He really infiltrated into the origins and did a very convincing job. I expected no less form him, after all he is a great actor.If you liked the first three films of the series, you shouldn't miss this one. It's not what it could have been, but at least you'll find out some interesting facts about our main slasher, and also see some great CGI.I was also surprised to see Ryan Reynolds in this movie.

True, it took license regarding some of the verbiage and detail of the novel, but it ultimately completely captured the characters, their transformations, their strengths, their vulnerabilities and their passions. You simply cannot do a definitive work on Pride and Prejudice in two hours. And this film doesn't try. But what it does attempt--to capture the story and characters, it does beautifully. It is well acted, well directed and connects as the book connected.

But in this friendly chaos a lone survivor who was bitten became an infected, but with a immunity to its shortcomings.

Every idea in modern society seems to diminish the natural ability of people to dream and to remember what they dream. A film like this exploits the natural interest people have in dreams to tell an impossible story. As entertainment it is passable, even interesting...as information on dreaming it is not only worthless, it takes the mind away from any hope of effective dreaming. This is the toxic nature of the film-making experience, where we see reality in such a skewed and unreliable way that we no longer understand reality. Human society has surrendered its powers to dream to the church, to the university, to the corporate paymaster and so modern life is for most people dreamless. Given an opportunity to bring some great idea about dreaming to the screen, the filmmakers instead make a fantasy that is complicated, over-acted and so unrealistic I am just amazed that so many dreamless people have given it such a high rating. Dreaming takes place inside the human spirit, real dreaming takes place among groups of people. But people no longer know this. Dreaming evolved in the human mind from the many thousands of generations people spent living and sleeping together...which they no longer do. As an experienced dreamer I think this film is useless.

Bros. who couldn't come up with real comedy to save their lives (Kingpin *did* have its moments, though). Liar, Liar was a fantastic film, as was Nutty Professor I. And how about Murphy in Bowfinger? Absolute brilliance! Why oh why do we keep paying the Farrelly Bros. and all their imitators to keep churning out these stomach-churning wastes of celluloid?!? They must have us all under a spell or something. I didn't know Irene was a Farrelly movie, or I wouldn't have gone to see it. I left the theatre that night feeling dirty and disgusted.\",\n",
              " 'First of all, I am a HUGE fan of Billy Bob Thornton. He is without a doubt one of my favorite actors working today, but with Bad Santa he illustrates, unfortunately, that even he is capable of providing a wonderful performance in an awful, awful movie. The abysmal script for Bad Santa calls for a relentlessly unlikable, distasteful person, and Billy Bob does more than necessary to fill that requirement. He is a remarkably versatile actor, I can\\'t help being reminded of the diversity of such roles as the government official in Armageddon, the greasy mechanic in U-Turn, the intense racist in Monster\\'s Ball, the rather slow brother in the shocking film A Simple Plan, and the peculiar character that he played in Sling Blade.\\nUnfortunately, the fact that Billy Bob is among the most powerful actors acting today is not enough to add something to the empty script of Bad Santa, which scarcely has any more reason for existence than do the ridiculous Scary Movies, which are abysmally awful films which I am notorious for repeatedly badmouthing - and for good reason - in dozens of my other reviews.(spoilers) Billy Bob Thornton plays the part of a dedicated drunk named Willie (who deserves no last name and so is given none) who plays the part of the shopping mall Santa Claus once a year, with his sidekick Marcus (Tony Cox who cleverly gets upset at being called \"you people,\" something which he hasn\\'t done since Me, Myself, and Irene. These writers are so creative!!!). Marcus and Willie do not do the job because they enjoy it or because they are interested in earning a little extra cash for the holidays, they do it because being employees at the mall gains them access to the mall after closing. Marcus hides somewhere, then jumps out of hiding as the last security guard arms the alarm and walks out of the mall. Marcus jumps out and disarms the alarm before it can arm completely (thus eliminating the annoying need for a code or password), and he then lets Willie in from where he has been waiting somewhere outside. The two proceed to rob the mall blind.Thus enters the premise which allows room for the comedic content, if you can call it that, of the film. Willie\\'s an alcoholic who apparently survives the rest of the year on the money that he steals from one mall after another on his nationwide bad Santa sprees. Since he makes all of his money from stealing from the malls, it\\'s not hard to see that he\\'s not going to really enjoy being surrounded by slobbering kids all day since he is not interested in the hourly wage in the first place. Thus follows lots of groan-inducing streams of profanity sprayed at unsuspecting kids and their equally unsuspecting parents.Now, the profanity is one thing. It got real old real quick, but it\\'s still, as they say, just one thing. Then you have the fact that Willie is constantly falling over drunk, smashing empty booze bottles against fancy SUVs in the parking lot on his way into the mall, and a whole array of other hideous infractions of basic decency. When I think about the character of Willie from this movie, I\\'m reminded of Melvin Udall from As Good As It Gets whose communication with the world, as Roger Ebert noted, was `limited to insults intended to harm.\\' But Jack Nicholson provided a charm to the character that I believe Billy Bob could also have provided Willie, had this ridiculous script called for it even in the most distant way. I\\'m also reminded of Billy from Buffalo \\'66, another hideously unattractive and straight-forwardly mean person who displayed the social skills I expect must have been common sometime around the Cretaceous Period, but Billy was an ugly person in a movie that was also deliberately ugly. It was a compilation of cinematic skill that made Buffalo \\'66 (and Billy) look and act the way it/he did. Bad Santa is ugly and mean because the humor is simply bad.\\nIf I were to summarize, I would just say that if you are entertained by seeing an aging drunk screaming streams of profanity at a preteen boy for a HUNDRED AND THIRTY FIVE MINUTES, then PLEASE watch this movie, you are sure to enjoy it. Personally, I think that there are some things that simply have no place in modern mainstream entertainment. Mostly all of them can be found conveniently compiled in the Scary Movies (which collectively play like a `What Not To Do\\' list for aspiring filmmakers), but there are plenty more examples found here in Bad Santa.While I didn\\'t HATE the movie, I can\\'t help automatic feelings of surprise and disbelief whenever I hear anyone say that they enjoyed it, even on a basal level. The movie is so callous and so ugly and so uncomfortable that even the good elements, like the fact that Willie supposedly is `changed\\' for the better (really, could he possibly have been changed for the WORSE?) by the little boy who inexplicably falls in love with him, are not enough to counter the intense ugliness of the character of Willie himself.\\nUgly movies can be successful and impressive (epitomized most recently, I think, in the case of Buffalo \\'66), but violence, alcohol, extensive criminal activities, and mass quantities of profanity mixed with the almost constant presence of young children is the absolute extent to which an ugly film can go horribly, horribly wrong. Personally, I always find it a little bit sad that filmmakers think that modern American audiences would be entertained by something like this. Even more than that, I find it sad that, a lot of times, they\\'re right.',\n",
              " 'May contain spoilers!There were many great things about this reboot. First off it had a great plot (a bit predictable but not by that much to hurt it) critics and people who CLEARLY have not watched much Star Trek say that it has too many plot holes but maybe if they paid attention to that this movie series is based in a alternate time line and not set on the same time line as TOS/TNG. It incorporated lines from wrath of khan but was not parodying it as many critics of the movie have been saying. Because the Star Trek franchise was in hibernation they needed to appeal to a wider audience to keep it afloat this may have taken a hit on star fleets diplomacy and ask questions first shoot latter but the new style of action has done the franchise well Please ignore the critics and harsh reviewers and GO WATCH THIS MOVIE',\n",
              " \"George Roy Hill's The Sting (1973) is the ultimate crime-does-pay movie. It reunites Robert Redford and Paul Newman (fresh from Butch Cassidy & The Sundance Kid) as a pair of loose canon con artists. Redford is Johnny Hooker, a reprobate being groomed by slight of hand master, Luther (Robert Earl Jones). Together, the two devise and carry out an elegant con that nets them a tidy bank roll. However, when mob boss Doyle Lonigan (Robert Shaw) learns of their deception, he orders his men to rub out Luther and Johnny. Hooker is shaken down by crooked \\x96 if slightly sympathetic police lieutenant, Will Snyder (Charles Durning). But Luther is killed, sending Johnny on a mission to avenge his mentor by employing one of his old acquaintances, Henry Gondorf (Newman). Henry used to be a man in the chips. Now he's yesterday's news. But is he ready to throw in the towel and become a legitimate and productive member of society just yet? Director Hill peppers the plot in a series of ironic mishaps and implausible twists that somehow never become contrived. The culminating shake down and final con is memorably set to the music of Scott Joplin's ragtime.I'm not sure what Universal means when they advertise a disc as 'digitally remastered with completely restored audio.' Does that suggest that the video is only partially restored? After a dismal initial offering from Universal, which was NOT widescreen \\x96 but then even more insultingly repackaged and advertised as a collector's edition \\x96 we get a 2-disc Legacy Edition DVD of The Sting. It IS widescreen and thankfully enhanced for 16X9 displays. However, the image quality presented throughout is hardly something to get excited about. As with the previously issued full frame disc, colors remain pasty, slightly faded and generally unnatural looking. Flesh tones are usually too pink or slightly orange \\x96 but never appearing as natural. Contrast levels are weak. Blacks are rarely deep or solid. Whites are more bluish or grayish than white. Overall the characteristic of the image is soft. Occasionally we get some nice crisp looking close ups of Newman or Redford in which fine detail on clothing and make up can be observed, but for the most part details become lost in a dull looking image that has little to recommend it. The audio has been remixed to 5.1, DTS and a cleaned up Mono track (as originally presented in theaters). The 5.1 and DTS offer virtually the same listening experience \\x96 flat, largely isolated in the center channel and with little to no separation \\x96 except in the musical tracks and occasional sound effect. Otherwise, they might as well have been mono.Extras on disc 2 boil down to an extensive documentary on the film's creation, success and longevity, inexplicably divided into three chapters that abruptly end, and are really a reason for Universal to advertise them as three extra features \\x96 rather than one giant one. There is NO audio commentary track \\x96 a gross oversight for a 70s flick as beloved as this one is. Overall then, The Sting gets recommended as a must have on this time around. But it's not the reference quality collector's piece that it might have been. Oh well, the con is still on.\",\n",

Asian people have such a different way of life then us and it really shows in their movies. watching foreign films is such a nice break from the usually westernized films we see all the time.there is quite a complicated story here, but not only is it complicated it is very strange, very unpredictable and just weird. i love it. Oh Dae-Su is mysteriously and suddenly imprisoned for 15 years without an explanation. he is then released. throughout the entire film he is just a play toy of some deranged man who gets pleasure from watching Oh Dae-Su do ridiculous horrible things, things Oh Dae-Su himself does not realize he is doing.stories don't get much more bizarre then this one but it is a very entertaining movie and i totally enjoyed every second of it. this movie stepped outside the boundaries and that is why it has become so popular, this movie is not afraid to include pedophiles, and men who commit incest. and because of that it makes for a much more interesting story.the camera work and scenery is very masterful and beautiful, it is a very visually pleasing movie, and it leaves you feeling good, or me anyways, i mean sure some people may be offended by this film, but perhaps that's just because they are too stuck and have stopped mentally growing,they cannot handle films that are outside their bubbles of reality or they it is just not up their alley.either way i highly recommend watching this film, if you don't like then its just not for you, i would say if you like stories like kill bill etc then you should defiantly check this one out.\",\n",
              " \"Personally, I thought that the second movie was better than the first one. Vol 1 didn't have a plot, just massive killing and the revenge to kill Bill. I fast forwarded through the whole fight scene in the restaurant when the Bride was going to kill O-Ren. The scene was ridiculously long and the killing was so dumb. Like when the Bride cut off a person's arm the blood squirts out like a water fountain... unrealistic. Also I thought the whole anime scene was bad. Yes, unique because not a whole lot of movies incorporate cartoon drawings to the movie but c'mon. The second one actually had more plot than random killing. There was emotion and a story. The whole situation came out as to why Bill tried to kill Bea Kiddo. But there was still awesome action so it balanced out. I loved when she crawled out of the grave and went to the diner for a glass of water. Hilarious!! Not many movies can pull off a better sequel but this one has!! One thing I didn't understand. Why didn't she finish off the girl with the eye patch (sorry I forgot her name). She poked out the eyeball but why not finish her?? Or did she?\",\n",

From the very outset, one is immediately transported into a beautiful yet claustrophobic atmosphere. Impressive visual effects and exquisite sound design reminded me of just why I love seeing movies on the big screen and this is an excellent cinematic experience.However, visual and aural pleasures don't maketh the movie. Unfortunately, what this film lacks is decent characterisations. While I can't fault the acting \\x96 Cillian Murphy was especially charismatic \\x96 the characters never evolved beyond mere role-plays, in that I felt no emotional connection with any of them. For me to fully engage in a story, I think this is a necessity.The ultimate letdown was the story which, although it's a great idea, never got beyond that. Whilst there were many different themes it could've explored, the film instead went down a strangely predictable path bereft of any major subtext.If you're a sci-fi fan that likes a good thriller then I recommend seeing this film on the big screen \\x96 a DVD just wouldn't do it justice. If, however, you like a film with a bit more meat on it then maybe skip this one and read a good book instead.\",\n",

This movie is a testimony to the masses' craving for mediocrity. I am a fan of the Johnny and June Carter Cash. The film, Angels with Angles, has a tremondous performance by Frank Gorshin. He portrays George Burns flawlessly. It is too bad that Gorshin was not part of a well publicized film like Walk the Line, or that Burns-mania is not currently a trend. Angels with Angles is not very good...but Gorshin is. If they are going to hand out award nominations to actors portraying iconic dead people..then Gorshin should have been nominated.\",\n",
              " 'I had read that they pushed this one into the R-rated zone due to the success of Deadpool and the brutality it had. A very good choice, although a very different movie. (The Deadpool short that was before this I found very strange and fell flat. Not very superhero-esque.)But back to Logan. What stood out to me was the acting. I personally would put Jackman (lead actor) and Stewart (supporting) up for Oscars. Some very nice work from both, although the material gave them that opportunity. Both parts (especially Jackman\\'s) were significantly physical and required displaying intense pain (and succeeded where DeCaprio\\'s portrayal in The Revenant didn\\'t come close. But to me that was more an overdue Oscar for him vs. an actual valid win.) The little girl was even very effective. The pairing of both her and Jackman was highly-touted but really didn\\'t come into play until very late in the film, when they had the argument in the stolen truck after she takes him to the doctor. The dark turn in this was refreshing vs. the previous sanitized versions of Wolverine in the past. Gritty and mean. Captured damaged characters well, although didn\\'t give them a backstory about why they were like that. (The element of the Nurse being killed was odd. The young bad guy thought Logan had killed her, and vice versa. But they never assigned blame.)The purpose of the journey was lacking, though. Very vague on how the Eden location came to be. It was a bit odd that they introduced the supposed red-herring of it being from a comic book and then it actually being real. (We repeatedly saw the coordinates of the location but they never used them in actually finding it.) And no explanation why \"crossing the border\" was a cure-all to all their ills. No reason why the bad guys would give up after that and why they would not just chase them into Canada.I didn\\'t find the direction that significant. The brutality of the action was much needed but then the action became muddled when the baddies kept missing the girl when they shot at her and bullet holes appeared in the limo in the following scene, not at that moment. The scene at the hotel when Xavier had his seizure was vague as it seemed that not all the patrons were frozen. I didn\\'t care either for the car strippers in the initial scene being Mexican. I would have err\\'d on the side of political correctness and made them white. It would not have made a difference in the end product. The presence of a wall between the US and Mexico was an interesting turn. Probably inserted when Trump\\'s nonsense came up in \\'16.But, in the end, I found it very effective, despite it\\'s shortcomings.',\n",

In moments it was very good, but all in all, nothing special. But i saw it like an intro to the story so i could live with it. For the most people i know, movie was too boring. I spent lots of time in defending P.J., trying to explain that this is just first movie and it will be much better in part II, especially in part III, the last movie about Middle Earth, Hobbits and all of those nice and the other not so nice creatures that entertained us for so many years.But how wrong was i....The Desolation of Smaug (2013.) has some (somebody could say: a lot, and will say nothing wrong) flaws, has some inconsistency in script, but i have forgiven P.J. because i was too sure that The Battle of Five Armies (2014.) will be a spectacle, one great finish of Middle Earth saga.But P.J. has laughed and spat in the face to all of Tolkien and LOTHR fans.I have watched movie last night and for the first time in my life i wanted to get out of the cinema in the last third of the movie! So clumsy and unhandy directing, flaws in script, bad CGI, mockery and absolutely NO emotions. What happened to P.J.?? Satiation? J.R.R.

Duke reads to the woman who demonstrates advanced senile dementia and his story serves to recollect and intrigue from her fuzzy memory. The story he reads of Noah (Ryan Gosling) and Allie (Rachael McAdams) is set in the pre-WWII rural south where he is a blue collar mill worker earning 41 cents an hour, and she is the lively daughter of wealthy parents who want her to make a good match. Noah and his father (Sam Shepard) are wealthy in other ways with their love of poetry which is integral to their relationship, while Allie is defined by the pressures for young women of patrician upbringing of the era.Gosling and McAdams as the young lovers are vibrant, endearing, and explosive on screen as first love blossoms to overtake the plans of Allie's parents for her education at Sarah Lawrence College. While Noah's father supports his choice, Allie's parents are not delighted with their daughter. It is a familiar story of poor boy loves rich girl, pampered girl wants to please her family, and her family wants the best for their child and will go to whatever gets the daughter married to the rich nice guy (James Marsden). Noah and Allie fight, love, and are fated to be separated by the classism of her parents, the war, and her willingness to go along with the expectations of southern society, or so the audience is lead to believe. Noah rebuilds his dream house, rows on the lake, and pines.Young lovers are contrasted by the devotion of Duke to the woman, and their relationship is the downside of the story as bodies and memories failing, the senior couple have their own problems -- his health and her inability to remember. Visited by grown children and grandchildren, Duke is revealed as Noah, and the woman is Allie. Although loving and supportive of their parents, the children want their father to leave the nursing facility and return to them because they recognize the hopelessness of their mother's inability to recollect her husband, her children and grandchildren, and their long marriage. But, Noah is committed to his sweetheart and stays by her side hoping for a miracle that will bring her memory back. So, he reads to her their story each day and waits for brief moments of lucidity to manifest.The film is a wonderful example of exquisite cinematography, storytelling, superior casting, and picturesque location that unites in a rare film of charm and sentiment without deteriorating into maudlin emotionalism. With disposable marriages the norm for contemporary society, The Notebook presents the fading notion of loyalty, devotion, and commitment for a lifetime. It is a gentle film with old fashion values and as characterized by Gosling and McAdams, Noah and Allie experience the joys and heartbreak that long lived romantic love creates till death do part.\",\n",

Perhaps seventy eight years old Eastwood started seriously contemplating mortality and what would be a good way to go with a bang, one can entertain such thoughts, even when not in a hurry to die. Self-sacrifice always sells - how anyone can object? And how such a gun-man as Eastwood can go, other than by a gun? You just can\\'t teach old dog new tricks. I think it is too late for him to start making new kind of film, he already have said all he could say and now just cuts and pastes from his earlier work. Yes, he was great in his genre, (spaghetti) westerns. He was the best in Sergio Leone films and very good as Dirty Harry. But how good is he now? With almost limitless film media released every year and systemic lack of time to view it, when planing to invest some of this precious time to see a film, of a good quality, I dare to say something new, it should be a lesson to all of us not to expect anything new from a person with fifty-year career behind him, who amply demonstrated what he\\'s capable of, and not to waste our precious time in vain hope to find something new in his work.

I felt I spent two hours watching at the desperate attempts of the cast of getting my attention, when I could really only focus and enjoy on Vin Diesel's brilliant performance. I don't know if it was a poor script or if James Gunn didn't feel as inspired with this cast as with Sarah Michelle Gellar and friends.

I think this movie is quite realistic, sad, brutal and depressing at the same time. The story about three friends living in the cruel nature of ghetto, full of drugs, violence, gang wars etc. is shown very realistic and without any judgment or statement at the end of the movie, because the movie doesn't need that. Boyz n the hood is family drama about nonsense of gang violence, but what I like the most is that the movie doesn't show stereotypical characters and environment of the ghetto. The characters in the movie are shown like a people, who are trying to escape from the cruel nature of the streets, where death awaits. The movie is dealing with a lot of controversial themes (racism, loss of good friend, gang violence, unexpected pregnancies, violence without any sense) and I think that most directors would make this movie cheesy and pathetic, but Singelton managed to put together everything together in a beautiful and sad drama about young lives lost in the battle of streets. The three main characters are shown really great, I like the fact that Ice Cubes character change his behavior after shooting another gang member - this shows that even the hard boiled gangster like him is thinking about meaning of violence and killing another black brother. That shows that the violence is really just a illusion to solve problems. This also shows that the movie is realistic and doesn't show a life in the ghetto in stereotypical way.All the actors are great from Cuba Gooding Jr., Laurence Fishburne to Ice Cube.

This is really the only live-action musical I can still watch. I've noticed as I've gotten older, a lot of other live-action musicals don't connect with me as much, but this one does. Maybe it's because it off-sets the randomness of people breaking into song with them getting their throats slit? The songs are all great and recognizable, Depp and Carter are good opposites for each other, Tim Burton brings his usual whimsy to the film, and it's a refreshing take on the musical genre.

Pardon me there was nothing in it that would rate as slightly funny. The lack of characterisation was frustrating, and really unacceptable, firstly we suddenly see the lead character naked in a hot tub with several women and at least one man, he explains without prompting that he is a congressman when surely he would be more likely to hide the fact, at least until he had got one of the hookers into bed.(Or is that how all politicians behave?) Julia Roberts, now an interesting choice of casting, great actress, but this part needed a Meryl Streep, and just how and why did she contact Wilson? Her motive or interest was never explained. Wilson\\'s first visit to Afghanistan was badly handled, the meeting with the prime minister very shallow, would he really have been in the room without any sort military adviser, he seemed very lacking in diplomatic skills? The visit to the refugee camp didn\\'t raise any emotion. The \\'Russian\\' fighters being \\'shot down\\' were allied aircraft footage, from stock shots. All in all a very unsatisfactory and unmemorable film.',\n",
              " 'One of the mysteries of modern life is how this motion picture currently comes to occupy its No 4 spot on the IMDb list of all-time greats. If not totally insane, the story is undeniably either ridiculous, ludicrous, hilarious or risible. Perhaps the word I\\'m looking for is laughable. I\\'m not saying it isn\\'t entertaining. It is that also.It is an American Western partly written by an Italian director, Sergio Leone, who shot it in Spain. He invented a new cinematic genre, by linking the maniacal overstatement of Italian grand opera with the Spanish picaresque tradition, as he himself has indicated. Picaro is a Spanish word for \"rogue\" or \"rascal\", and the picaresque novel is usually satirical, depicting, \"in realistic and often humorous detail, the adventures of roguish heroes of low social class who live by their wits in a corrupt society.\" The viewer is asked to believe that two picaros, Clint and Eli, can make good money, if not a steady living, claiming bounty rewards for Eli\\'s sins (which include playing cards with a marked deck), and then having Clint shoot through the rope which is hanging Eli, from some considerable distance. Eli then fortunately stays sitting on his conveniently placed horse which gallops away. Pull the other one; it\\'s got bells on.For a detailed exposition of the plot, and the different putative locations, see the FAQ, which is required reading if some sense is to be made of the narrative, as filmed. This is of little help when actually watching, however.Two of the weirdest scenes occur at the very beginning, and at the very end. The opening starts with one of Leone\\'s trademark facial closeups, of a peculiarly evil-looking individual. A little further on Eli bursts through a window. Difficult to tell why, since he leaves about three gunmen dead on the floor of the room which he has just left. He was apparently in the middle of gnawing his dinner.Some way into the movie we leave Spain, which has been doubling for Mexico, and enter what looks like the Sahara desert. I was expecting at least a camel, or possibly Omar Sharif, to materialize out of the sand. But no, instead we get a driverless coach and six, full of dead and dying soldiers, coming out of nowhere like a bat from hell --- had we wandered into Hammer Films territory? Skip to the end, where our two heroes, Clint and Eli, now find themselves in what has been called a Mexican standoff with evil-eyed Lee van Cleef. Difficult to know why he hadn\\'t been shot a long time earlier, since he didn\\'t appear to have any valuable information about where the buried treasure was, like the other two. Anyway, he sure gets shot now in an amazingly pointless and prolonged three-cornered duel, which takes place in a uniquely circular cemetery, specially designed for the standoff.Leone is fond of scenes where a man is shown to be terrified by suspension from a rope round his neck. This turns up four times in this movie, and once more in his far greater masterpiece, OUATITW. This film (GBU) is much inferior, but you can\\'t say it isn\\'t entertaining. Clint is cool, and the rest of it is comical, and brutal. Look out for Cpl Wallace. Eli takes his gun into his bath with him. Never saw that in a Western before.',\n",

There is not a moment in this film where I wasn\\'t either on the brink of crying, laughing or laughing outright.The story is fairly simple and could easily have been made shorter. But it doesn\\'t feel overlong in any way, much less boring or uninteresting. On the contrary. This is an Oscar film, worth at least four or five for best performances and for best picture and best script.I envy Stephen King for being able to think these stories up.

              " 'Before you turn away, know this: I\\'m a huge Spiderman fan; he\\'s my favorite superhero and I adored the first two. I liked this movie, but it\\'s more complicated than this. I was about to go see it again with some friends tomorrow, but now I won\\'t. I don\\'t even know if I should get it on DVD or add it to my favorites, although I\\'ll probably do both (I can\\'t have 1 and 2 and not have 3). In the long run though, I believe that this movie was a dreadful victim of circumstances and had the potential to be something much greater and better (and if Sam Raimi had stuck to his original plan for it rather than listening to Avi Arad and Laura Ziskin, I\\'m sure it would have). So anyway on to the review. This movie was two and a half hours long, but for all it contained, it was still too short. Too much was packed into this movie; far, far too much. Too many villains, and too many characters. Gwen Stacy was entirely unnecessary (even played by the wonderful Bryce Howard), and one of the villains, be it Venom or Sandman, also had to be left out. In fact, the entire plot was a mess and instead of making sense, it was only more confusing from one moment to the next, up to the point when you couldn\\'t but wonder, \\'what are they on about now?\\'. The acting in this movie wasn\\'t exactly something to write home about, and Tobey Maguire disappointed me the most (and I wish I didn\\'t have to say that because he is one of my favorite actors). His acting suffered greatly from the writing his character suffered from. Most of his on-screen time, he looked like he didn\\'t quite know what to do with himself or what they wanted from him. He had no idea what his character should be like in (whatever) particular situation and frankly, I can\\'t blame him, because neither did I. as an actor, I\\'m sure this film was hell on earth to go through. The supporting actors were all rather flat as well, and Kirsten Dunst has given, again, one of her less-than-admirable performances (and unlike Tobey, she can\\'t quite blame it on her character). The only ones I can praise in this movie to a certain extent are James Franco and Rosemary Harris. They are the only ones, in this chaos, that managed to somehow make sense, and bearing in mind their character suffered the least, they at least had it easy. Some scenes in the film were so cheese dripping that I wanted to choke. I actually laughed out loud in that dreadful all-American scene of Spiderman popping up in front of the flag. The American patriotism and the idiotic news report simply killed the movie all on their own to a certain extent. That aside, there was far too much symbolism, and what\\'s worse, for some reason they felt they had to spell it out for us, and what is even worse than overdone symbolism is obvious symbolism. The religious connotations in the church ridding him of evil and the bad guy (who abused god for evil) getting it on himself instead was way overdone, and same with Harry\\'s half mutilated face, apparently reflecting his inner battle, and of course there is more. And just something I wonder couldn\\'t his all-knowing butler tell him that daddy had died by his own hand before Peter kicked half of his ass? Of course not, because that would have actually made sense. Leaving out New York\\'s obsession with Spiderman and the utterly and dreadfully idiotic Spiderman-parade would have made sense also. Most of the themes examined in this film were too far fetched and undeveloped. The father-daughter thing with Sandman made me roll my eyes (me, the ultimate daddy\\'s girl!), Eddie\\'s idiotic competitiveness-turned-vengeance-gig got the same reaction. The Peter/M.J storyline was completely senseless and there was absolutely no reason for them to be so unrecognizably messed up that I could see. They should have just given them their happily-ever-after cheese and moved on. The only good thing was the Peter/Harry relationship development, but even that was somewhat scorched around the edges. In fact, Harry was almost the only good thing about it, and to top the already misguided and flawed ending, they killed him off. The special effects were awesome, nothing to say there. The black-suited Spiderman was absolutely fantastic and I loved every second. However, the special effects were, also, overdone. There were simply too many of them. The best thing about special effects is when they are done within reason, when you consciously don\\'t notice them. Unfortunately, it was not the case in \"Spiderman 3\". The battles themselves often felt like lesser remakes of something we had seen in the previous two films, and that was a shame. I can\\'t say I was all-around happy with the way they were done. There were, of course, quite a few good moments. The black-Spiderman scenes were superb, as well as some of Tobey\\'s other scenes (especially in the evil-Peter capacity), such as his little performance in the jazz club, that was really fun to watch. His teaming up with Harry in the end was also rather well done. Well what else is there to say, really? I don\\'t know. I\\'m thinking right now about something definitely good that I could point out, but I seem to have run out of those (already pointed out the ones that were worthwhile). Yes, I know for a fact now, I will get this film on DVD because I simply can\\'t not add it to my collection, and hell, the Peter/Harry dynamics and the black suit alone made it worthwhile. And still, I can\\'t help but wish for so many things to have been different. I was expecting this one to be the best of the three, and I\\'m afraid it just might be the worst.',\n",
              " 'Christian Bale, Amy Adams, Bradley Cooper, Jennifer Lawrence, and Jeremy Renner do the \"American Hustle\" in this 2013 film, directed by David O. Russell, who co-wrote the screenplay with Eric Singer.It is 1978. Con artist and imprisoned Irving Rosenthal (Bale) and his partner Sydney (Adams) have to work with an FBI agent, Richie DiMaso (Cooper) to bring down white collar criminals in order to be free of all charges. Eventually. Richie and Irving are led to the rebuilding of Atlantic City into an east-coast Las Vegas, a project that will be rich with payoffs to politicians and investment scams. Irving, Sydney (known as Ethel in her British accent) and Richie get to work, meeting with the mayor of the city, Carmine Polito (Renner) who sincerely wants to put people back to work and bring in revenue for the city and state. Unfortunately, he seems to believe the end justifies the means and is willing to break the law to achieve his dream of a gambling mecca.The situation goes from edgy to downright scary when the mob (led by Robert de Niro) comes to town to talk with the fake sheik (actually from Mexico) about making a $10 million investment.This is an absolutely hilarious film with wonderful performances and bizarre situations. Part of the beginning is Christian Bale working on his hair, teasing, pasting on pieces, and then spraying. We\\'re actually brought into the middle of a situation, and the film works back. We see Sydney\\'s and Irving\\'s stories, we see them meet and fall in love, and developing their various cons, fake loan sharking (charging $5000 to loan $50,000 but the mark never sees the $50,000) and a fake art scam.We learn that Irving is married to Rosalyn (Lawrence) and he has adopted Rosalyn\\'s son from her first marriage. For this reason, he is reluctant to leave her. The problem is, out in public, she has a tendency to drink too much and say too much.Part of the charm of this film is the \\'70s atmosphere -- gold-dipped wall patterns, carpeting, heavy furniture, black and white photos of babies, the discos, Nehru jackets, bouffants, streaked hair, girdles, stereos, and the music: Bee Gees, Blood, Sweat & Tears, Billy Joel, Steely Dan, America, and Irving and Sydney\\'s favorite throwback, Duke Ellington. I\\'ll admit that I don\\'t really remember the style dress Amy Adams wore throughout the film, cut down to her navel with part of each boob showing.The film has lively, wild performances by Christian Bale, with a gut sticking out and horrid hair -- when a leading man, especially a handsome one, does that, it gets a lot of attention. But Bale follows through with a great performance. Adams is sexy and funny. Lawrence is hilarious. Some might say that she and Elizabeth Rohm, who plays the mayor\\'s wife, are caricatures, but frankly, they were like a lot of women I\\'ve known. Jeremy Renner as the mayor is wonderful - sincere, naive, and a little low class. And Bradley Cooper as a man living with his mother and engaged to a girl from the neighborhood is fantastic as a no-boundaries FBI agent.Just marvelous, particularly for my generation. I had a blast.',\n",
              " 'THIS is perhaps the greatest film ever made. A passionately penned down portrait revolving on the downfall of the West-era. Brilliantly filmed, with careful attention for the smallest detail and performed by gifted actors and actresses in not so obvious roles. Straight from the slow and clammy opening credits sequence, you notice that this is an epic that will require your full attention and one that\\'ll automatically provoke great feelings of respect and admiration. A cowboy\\'s struggle with a fly is portrayed like it is a devastating battle, guided by unnatural noises on the background that put an extra emphasis on the unbearably tropic climate. This is the merciless West and you need your eyes and ears focused at all times to avoid trouble with someone more powerful than you. I have seen this masterpiece of film-making numberless times now and I still get mesmerized instantly when I behold the atmospheric set-pieces and the ominous characters. A truly magnificent opening to what will become a powerful movie experience and yet nothing of the actual storyline has been revealed yet!\"Once upon a time in the West\" is a collaboration between titans...For the flawless screenplay, Leone (already a master-writer himself) received assistance from no less than Bernardo Bertolucci and Dario Argento (this latter is a personal God of mine). These icons, who already deserve statues for the work they did separately, combine their talents and deliver a genuine western story that involves organized crime, blackmail, revenge and even human emotions. Separate story lines that only come together neatly in the end, after a series of fascinating sequences filled with suspense and dazzling action. Leone grabs every chance to innovate with both hands and this results in unexpected shock moments (the slaughter of the Irish family) and even completely unimaginable anti-castings (Henry Fonda as a relentless gangster?). The main story lines are very diverse but Leone takes his time to slowly clarify them all. Tough guys are hired secure the construction of a railroad while a notorious gangster escapes from jail, only to find out that someone abused his trademarks to get their dirty work done. A beautiful woman has been widowed without knowing it and she stands alone in an abandoned, dangerous land. And then there\\'s a lonely cowboy patiently waiting to fight a personal battle of which no one knows the details. If you\\'ve chosen to watch \"Once upon a time in the West\", get ready to be overwhelmed by fascination and involvement...expect yourself to sit on the edge of your seat, exploring all the corners of the TV-screen as you want to make sure you\\'re not missing a thing! Leone could count on the perfect cast, with the already mentioned Henry Fonda in an unusual but fitting role and Claudia Cardinale who embodies every male creature\\'s dream. Charles Bronson and Jason Robards complete the great cast, both in the finest roles of their overall brilliant careers.The previously summed up elements already indicate that this is an unmissable cinema event and then I haven\\'t even spoken of the music yet! For many fans the ultimate reason to point out \"Once upon a time in the West\" as the greatest film ever made and they\\'re right! Ennio Morricone\\'s score is so marvelous, so perfect that it began to lead its own life outside the film. The constantly repeated tunes \"Man with the Harmonica\" and \"Goodbye to Cheyenne\" cause a chemical reaction inside your body every time and they provide the story with extra depth and atmosphere. The images on the screen and the music you hear form a wholesome that can never be topped in cinema. This is the best, period! We should only use superlatives when talking about this film: the BEST and the most UNIQUE In case I haven\\'t made myself clear thus far: \"Once upon a time in the West\" is a motion picture that belongs in every DVD-collection. With my most sincere apologies to Sam Peckinpah, John Ford and Howard Hawks but this is simply put the best western ever!',\n",

              " 'Teenagers thrive on science fiction and horror flicks because these renegade movies with their improbable pulp fiction plots appeal to youthful sentiments about alienation and the lack of power that juveniles wrestle with in an adult-dominated society. Not surprisingly, \"Desperado\" director Robert Rodriguez\\'s clever but derivative creature feature \"The Faculty,\" starring Elijah Wood, Robert Patrick, Salma Hayek, and Famke Janssen, ridicules those traditional authority figures\\x97teachers, parents, and the police\\x97who curtail adolescent curiosity. As scripted by \"Scream\" scenarist Kevin Williamson, \"The Faculty\" amounts to an entertaining but irreverent hodgepodge of \"The Breakfast Club\" meets \"Invasion of the Body Snatchers\" with a scene or two from \"The Thing\" grafted on for good measure. While adults may cringe at the messages that crop up, teens will revel in this spooky, sometimes scary spectacle. Inevitably, any movie celebrating a drug dealer as a hero is bound to arouse the wrath of either the PTA or the PTO.The teachers at Herrington High School in suburban Ohio have started acting a little weird. Weird enough so that several students suspect aliens may have turned their faculty into puppets and are using them to stage a hostile takeover of not only their campus but also their town and perhaps even planet Earth. Of course, students have always felt that their teachers come from another cosmos, and \"The Faculty\" winks mischievously at this premise. Initially, nobody believes that anything adverse is occurring, and \"The Faculty\" unfolds like a hip 1990s\\' update of \"The Blackboard Jungle\" where the kids ruled the campus and the instructors were the casualties of an apathetic school board. An early scene invites such a comparison when Principal Drake (Bebe Neuwirth of \"Jumanji\") informs her burned-out faculty that only the football team will get any new funding. Everybody else will have to suffer. Forget those new computers for the classrooms; the drama teacher will have to recycle last year\\'s sets, and kiss any field trips goodbye.Things take an \"X-Files\" turn for the worst when Casey (Elijah Wood of \"Deep Impact\"), a geeky, non-entity that bullies love to bash, discovers an egg-roll shaped critter on the football field and lets his biology teacher, Mr. Furlong (Jon Stewart of \"The Daily Show\"), analyze it. Like a gremlin, this squirmy thing mutates after they dunk it in an aquarium. When Mr. Furlong sticks his hand in the tank, the things sprouts teeth and rips a chunk out of him. What the students don\\'t know yet is that the critter has already assailed their hotheaded football coach, Dick Willis (Robert Patrick of \"Terminator 2\"), and that he has attacked the Principal Drake. Furthermore, this parasite thrives on water, and eventually the entire faculty cannot seem to gulp enough water. Basically, this critter slips into your ears and takes over your body, a variation on Jack Sholder\\'s \"The Hidden\" (1987), but \"The Faculty\" parasite adds recruits to its zombie-like ranks instead of skipping from one host to another like \"The Hidden.\" Insidiously enough, the alien parasite plans to use the popular Friday night grid-iron contest to boost its numbers.Scenarist Kevin (\"I Know What You Did Last Summer\") Williamson populates \"The Faculty\" with a generic cross-section of high school types played by a talented young cast of fresh but little known faces. Shawn Hatosy brings humility to Stan, the star quarterback who quits the team in a fit of conscience to improve his grades. As his girlfriend Delilah, who heads the cheerleading squad and edits the school newspaper, Jordana Brewster of \"The Fast & The Furious\") is appropriately catty and snobbish. Delilah dumps Stan because his newly found academic efforts clash with her need for prominence. Wearing more make-up than Elvira, Clea DuVall of \"Heroes\" impersonates Stokely, a moody misfit unfairly accused of being a lesbian. Although Stokely isn\\'t really gay, she adopts the persona because she refuses to click with the cliques. Meanwhile, Zeke (Josh Hartnett of \"Halloween: H20\") pedals drugs and taboo videos out of the trunk of his GTO, but he conceals more brain cells than any druggie could, especially when he duels with his English teacher about poetry. According to the script, his irresponsible parents have abandoned him, so Zeke has the run of his house. Finally, as Mary Beth, the new babe on campus, Laura Harris deploys her designing Dixie charms to ingratiate herself with even the most dispossessed. No matter what she does, just about everybody shuns poor Mary Beth.Nothing is either as simple or as straight-faced as it first appears in Kevin Williamson\\'s ingenious script. Although the kids have found a cure, they must solve the mystery of who was first infested so that they can kill the parasite and free everybody. Complicating matters is that the alien\\'s army of zombies is multiplying like crazy, and the enemy has our heroes surrounded, outnumbered, and perhaps even infiltrated. Predictably, too, Zeke\\'s stash of narcotics runs low, and the kids have to run a gauntlet of zombies to grab what little drugs remain to destroy it. Director Robert Rodriguez generates sustained suspense as our heroes struggle to outfox the elude the alien spawn and rarely lets the momentum flag.Bristling with atmosphere, issues, and surprises, \"The Faculty\" qualifies as a witty, rip-snorting, reptilian chiller that never takes itself seriously. Good paranoid thrillers that keep audiences guessing up to fade out are few and far between. Indeed, the characters get the short shrift, but action rather than characterization propels \"The Faculty\" to its nail-biting finale. Nevertheless, the filmmakers offset the lack of character development with cinematic and literary references to genre classics. Stokely and Casey engage in an illuminating colloquy about sci-fi literature and point out that Robert Heinlein\\'s \"The Puppet Masters\" beats Jack Finney\\'s \"Invasion of the Body Snatchers\" to the book racks. On the other hand, they reveal that Hollywood has exploited Finney more frequently than Heinlein. Even if you abhor horror movies, you might be able to tolerate this playful, well-paced hellraiser.',\n",
              " \"For a movie that claims to be based on reality there are too much things that don't work in reality! I will only point out the two major flaws of the movie in this respect: 1) Tom Cruise falling with a fast pace towards a sensitive alarm wired floor! Yes he doesn't touch the floor, but the movie made us believe that this alarm that is installed in the floor is very sensitive ... well if it was, why didn't it go off? The pressure of the wind alone that Cruise's falling caused, should have triggered it (and I won't consider the fact, that a normal human being would be sweating like a pig, especially hanging like that ... any drop on the floor would have been the end of this heist/scam or whatever you want to call it) 2) The helicopter scene. Even people who like the movie more than me, do agree that this is totally bananas! Not only the fact that the helicopter goes into the tunnel or they used bad CGI (by today standards even more so), but for the fact that it literally stopped right in front of Mr. Cruise ... Again for a movie that tries to be real, a big suspension of disbelief isn't working here ...And then of course you have the BS plot, that anyone who has seen more than three thrillers can smell 10 miles against the wind ... Seriously it's so obvious and plain that there really is no suspense (oh and the fish tank explosion in the restaurant? What was that all about? Whatever!) Still the movie is shot and edited in a very professional way (you shouldn't expect otherwise from De Palma, the director here).

The same he always does his thing at the helm - while this one doesn\\'t have any explosive and extensive use of photogrammetry that Fight Club and Panic Room has; it still uses some of Fincher\\'s visual in your face gimmicks, like super impositions, slo-mo or just plain exquisite cinematography.Some of the first scenes do get you hooked. But as long as this film had to be that is where some will feel it dragging on - and despite the lengthiness of it all, I never found it boring. One cannot brand this as a standard \"whodunnit\" either because some clues are dropped overtly and blatantly, and when confusion manifests, it becomes a story device to keep you guessing. While some may find this inferior to his perturbing 95 masterpiece SE7EN, it is definitely lighter in tone, and consequently DOES offer much for those who want to have a good time at the movies.It ends with you having to decide, it even includes a rather bland but tension-coated moment where Gyllenhaal comes face to face with the (supposed) killer. But whatever you decide, the evidence the movie displays, including the supposed \"facts\" of title cards at the end can allow even those with an IQ of a gorilla to absorb what the film is trying to imply.Having said that ZODIAC is 4/5.',\n",

To start, the fact that it\\'s claiming to be a horror film is borderline insulting to the viewer considering it has absolutely nothing remotely unsettling in its one hundred minute duration. Honestly, this film is so aggressively not scary that I\\'m impressed the director somehow got a studio to sell this as a horror movie. Seriously, who would genuinely get so petrified by some dude that incessantly follows you at half a mile per hour? Hasn\\'t the guy who wrote this ever been to Baltimore?Anyways, besides the complete lack of scares, the film also fails on nearly every other level. Both the cast and the monster are forgettable in every way. I can\\'t decide which characters are given less backstory: the adolescents or \"It\". All the viewer knows about these elements are the humans\\' names and the mechanism by which \"It\" is transmitted. That\\'s all. Why should I be rooting for the characters if the writers purposely made them so surface-deep?Concerning the film\\'s style and tone (which critics apparently couldn\\'t praise enough), I thought it was lukewarm, although I will admit the score was the one thing I could begin to attempt to use the word \"good\" to describe. Unfortunately, no film can subsist on style alone. There is so little substance in this movie that I actually checked if I had accidentally chosen the wrong movie, given the above-average expectations that the critical acclaim caused me to have.To sum it up, this movie is unbelievably bad, not because it was irrevocably lame and boring, but because there was nothing positive to glean from this film. If there was a message, I missed it. If there were scares, I missed them. If there was a beginning, middle, and end, I missed it. At least Eragon (2006), a similarly awful production, made me appreciate the source material a little more. This film gives its audience nothing.

It's quite a disappointment to have this title made the way it was. Everything about it is predictable but that's not the bad thing, both of the earlier Shrek movies were fairly predictable but were successful in executing it in a funny, comedic and sometimes suspenseful manner. Shrek the Third completely fails here. It is predictable without being funny, comedic or engaging. Shrek and Fiona also both suffer from character derailment and act unlike themselves from the previous movies. In Shrek 1, we saw Shrek easily beat up shinning knights in armor, take on crossbow tooting elf goons in the second film, but here in the Third he easily gives up when confronted by a few soldiers. Meanwhile Fiona has become practically useless. Other parts of the story are so contrived. Fiona, her mom the queen and several other fairy tale girls are locked up halfway through but do nothing to escape until the end when the Queen conveniently knocks down the jail walls with her head. Heck why didn't she do it earlier? It's almost as if the writers stuck them in there and couldn't think of a way to get them out and ended up with this instead.And then there's the villain, Prince Charming. I honestly think it would have been better if they created a new villain from scratch because Prince Charming was portrayed as a vain airhead in Shrek 2 and it's so unbelievable when he easily turns a tavern full of depressed fairy tale villains to his side with a few words. Even more insane, at the end, the lost heir Arthur, also with a few naive words, convinces said tavern villains to throw down their weapons and make up.Ultimately, this leads to the rather poor and naive message of the movie regarding what people think of you and how it does not matter what other people think as long as you know yourself. Well guess what? Pretty much all the world's mass murderers, dictators, serial killers etc etc acted like that.All in all, I felt my money was wasted on this movie. The only upside is that I watched it on the same day I caught Transformers: The Movie which allowed me to see just how much of a mish-mash, half-cocked job they pulled on Shrek the Third. Don't watch this movie people, especially Shrek fans. You WILL be disappointed.\",\n",

              " \"This was the first film in what would become a non-stop high octane franchise full of cool and fast cars racing and chasing each other, including lots of action and some stunts along the way, directed by Rob Cohen (Dragonheart). Basically a string of high-speed truck robberies, stealing millions of dollars worth of electronic equipment, have been occurring, Los Angeles street racing gang leader Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) is under suspicion for these hijacking crimes. Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) is an officer for the LAPD and goes undercover, joining Toretto's highly skilled crew of racers, taking part in many illegal late night street races for high stakes. As time goes by however Brian is compromising his assignment by becoming part of Toretto's life, he is sympathising with the chief suspect, and falling in love with Toretto's sister Mia (The Faculty's Jordana Brewster), he eventually starts to try and prove Toretto's innocence. Also starring Michelle Rodriguez as Toretto's girlfriend Letty, Die Another Day's Rick Yune as Johnny Tran, Chad Lindberg as Jesse, Johnny Strong as Leon, Ted Levine as Sergeant Tanner, Matt Schulze as Vince, rapper Ja Rule as Edwin, Space Jam's Thom Barry as Agent Bilkins and Bruce Almighty's Noel Gugliemi as Hector. Diesel with his gravely voice is cool, Walker is blank most of the time but a reasonable hero, and supporting cast members Brewster and Rodriguez do fine as well. To be honest, the storyline going on is not the thing to pay the fullest attention to, as the title suggests it the pedal-to-the-metal stuff, all the colourful and cool cars fuelled up, with extra rocket boosters and switches, that speed and crash their way around, and the explosions and stunts along the way keep the pace up as well, all in all it is a worthwhile action thriller.

              " 'I have never experienced a science fiction movie that affected me so emotionally. I\\'m not sure why but I have some guesses.There is no question that part of it was due to the mesmerizing effect that Alicia Vikander (Ava) had on me. Her very expressive face with its wide range of emotional signals hit me right between the cerebellum. Or maybe it was the gonads. Or both. Director Alex Garland certainly found the girl with the magic in her face, because of course so much of this is about her face. Yes, because she must as a robot who is passing the Turing test be so, so very human, and humans express so much of what they are feeling in their faces. After all, that is the task of Turing test for the computer, to fool us (in this case the us is Dornhmall Gleeson who plays Caleb who is the human that must be fooled into thinking that she is human and not a computer). There is a great irony here in the answer: does she fool him or does she not, and what does it mean to fool him? The other aspect of the movie that affected me emotionally was the power struggle among the Nathan who is her sociopathic creator (Oscar Isaac), Caleb and Ava. It seems that I have lived this before. Who has the upper hand? Who has the trick that will allow him or her to prevail? Who has the power, and can that power be subverted? The power of this movie is in the realistic human interactions coupled with a cutting edge take on artificial intelligence.The ending is essential to understanding the film. Usually I don\\'t care about endings. It is the treatment, the acting, the direction, the ideas, the dialogue, etc. that matters. But in this case the ending is special. As you watch the movie try to guess the ending. And by the way this is one of those movies in which if you know the ending your appreciation of the movie will be diminished.The musical score by Geoff Barrow and Ben Salisbury is original, intriguing and sometimes obtrusive in a way that works with the action.Okay, now to what is wrong with this. Ava has a desire to escape and to be human or at least to appear human. The problem is robots or computers or software cannot possibly have such desires or desires at all unless they are programmed in. In truth Ava would be content (or actually neither content nor non content) to remain where she was. This is a strange bugaboo that many science fiction writers fall into when writing about artificial intelligence and indeed something that most people who even think about AI and robots fall into. To go even further, the fear that some people have about AI creatures taking over the world and rendering humans so much dust in the wind is fraudulent. There is an overriding distinction between biological creatures and artificial ones: the biological ones feel pain, have desires, etc. and the artificial ones do not. They have no desire to do anything, period--again unless programmed in.Could AI creatures somehow evolve to e.g., want to be superior? I would ask, but why? What is to be gained? It is only biological creatures that need to be in ascendant, to get more than the other creatures, to reproduce, etc. A machine would not, could not, and could only understand such desires in evolutionary beings.(Spoiler alert): I\\'ll keep this a bit vague, but I believe that Ava failed the Advanced Turing Test because she should have kept by her side the human who loves her. He might be helpful.--Dennis Littrell, author of \"The World Is Not as We Think It Is\"',\n",
              " \"I've never seen Evita on stage, but from watching this film it becomes very obvious that that is where this story belongs, and although certain musicals have translated very well into films ('the Phantom of the Opera' and 'Hairspray' being two that spring immediately to mind), this is one of those that I feel should have been left on stage. Saying that however, watching this film has made me very keen to see the musical in it's original format one day, and it is just a shame that it is no longer being shown in the West End.Whenever Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice get together for a musical, you know you're going to be in for a treat, and no matter what other reservations I have about this film, there is no doubting that musically, it is a masterpiece. There are many, very, very good songs, ('Oh, What a Circus' and 'I'd be Surprisingly Good for You', being two examples), which are only improved by casting Madonna as Eva (no matter what anyone may say about her acting, you cannot deny that her voice is sublime). On the topic of acting, although I feel that Madonna did look much too old for the role, her acting did vastly improve as the film went on, and if it wasn't for her age I would have said she made the perfect Eva Peron for her acting near the end was very powerful and conveyed a lot of emotion. I also really loved Antonio Banderas' casting as Che, but I have never seen a single performance by Banderas which I have disapproved of.I think the major issue with this film is that, being based off the musical, it's story is therefore somewhat limited (especially seeing as the musical was based off a real life event), and, rather than a climactic ending most movie-goers are used to seeing, the film never reaches a huge peak, but rather, fizzles out slowly. Although this is often acceptable whilst watching a musical in theatre, it doesn't translate very well on film.I did like this film, and am glad I watched it purely because it has now convinced me that I have to go see the musical on theatre next time it is close to me, but it wasn't a piece of filming masterpiece, even if it was genius on stage. I enjoyed i t while watching, but it's not one that I will watch again in a hurry.\",\n",

Simply this film is a clever study of the characters interacting. It all boils down to trust between these people, reflecting if they will survive.You can't help but be drawn in by this story, genuinely wondering who 'the thing' really is at the different points in the story. It is marvelously executed, and the end just adds a sense of mystery to the whole story.The film is very entertaining, not over long - and definitely should remain a classic for many years to come.\",\n",

The craftsmanship in the making of this film achieves an incredible realism in the oil derricks and equipment so that you are not left feeling that you can see the joins and feeling cheated. The DVD I have has a 15-minute extra which relates clips from the film with actual photographs taken during the period, so you can see the degree of accuracy achieved.But the film is strong on many layers, not just the documentary but also the presentation of real characters you can identify with so that you experience, not just see, the hardship, danger and brutality of the time and place. The characters are real and multi-faceted, with the plot being driven by logic rather than the political goals of the film makers.The film does have a few flaws, one of which is having Paul Dano playing both Paul Sunday and his brother Eli. Paul Sunday is instrumental in tipping off Danial about the new oil field on his family\\'s land, and I kept waiting for him to reappear. However the actor is now playing Eli and everyone\\'s forgotten about Paul\\'s existence. And there are a few gaps - how did Danial get to the Assayer\\'s office with a broken leg?

              " 'There\\'s not a lot of mystery in romantic comedies, aside from perhaps \"who\\'s the baby daddy?\" which is coincidentally not too far off from the hook Adam Brooks uses in his film \"Definitely, Maybe.\"There\\'s a comfort in the romantic comedy formula, in the predictable end of a tried romance. We derive a bit of pleasure as a romance plot drags us along the string of \"will they or won\\'t they?\" even though we know in our hearts what will happen (because if it doesn\\'t happen, our hearts will be broken and the movie will get bad-mouthed).\"Definitely, Maybe\" does as good a job of any rom-com at doing just that. We are sucked into the story with a premise nearly identical to CBS sitcom \"How I Met Your Mother,\" in which young Maya (Abigail Breslin) presses her father, Will, (Ryan Reynolds) into telling the story of how he met her mom. Seeing as the couple is a pair of signatures away from a divorce, he\\'s not thrilled at the prospect of reliving those moments, but for our entertainment, he indulges.The catch, of course, is that the story involves multiple women, and Maya must guess which one turns out to be her mother. Thus begins a long story that begins in 1992, when young(er) Will sets out for New York City to work on the Clinton campaign and leaves his serious girlfriend, whom he refers to as Emily (Elizabeth Banks), behind.The \\'90s American history backdrop definitely gives the film its own flavor. Brooks eventually tries to draw an analogy to the former president, but it\\'s half-hearted. Nonetheless, Brooks uses the opportunity to take an amusing jab at President George W. Bush among other humorous moments of hindsight and it\\'s a welcome aspect of the story.On the job he meets the copy girl (Isla Fisher), April, one of the mother candidates. She\\'s into rock music and edgier guys, and despite an attraction, things never seem to fall into place for them.Then there\\'s the woman referred to as Summer (Rachel Weisz), a sophisticated and confident aspiring journalist Will becomes particularly passionate about and eventually starts dating.So will it be Bachelorette No. 1, 2 or 3? Brooks definitely spent some time crafting this story to constantly bounce back and forth between the women as Will encounters them at multiple points in his life, constantly casting doubt over each one. The three actresses are stellar as well, so it really helps that even if you pick side, you kind of like all the characters for different reasons.Reynolds holds up well as a romantic lead. He\\'s a rather passive participant in his own love life, which is a bit frustrating but endearing. You genuinely root for his happiness despite fully understanding just why his love life has been so flawed. The impact it has on Maya is also sweet in all its obvious nature. She becomes as engrossed in the story as we do, though with a child-like innocence. Eventually she realizes that love really is as complicated as they say.The riddle doesn\\'t last nearly as long as it could, but for a romantic comedy it lasts longer than most. At some point the characters have been so fleshed out and certain details put in play that you can start to put the pieces together and figure out exactly how it will end. To Brooks\\' credit, however, he made what will be seen as a popular choice.\"Definitely, Maybe\" hits all over the rom-com spectrum if the left end represents fabrication and tons of cheese and the right is honesty, realism and poignancy. There\\'s a rather cloying scene in which Will and April hang out on April\\'s birthday after her boyfriend ditches her for a gig and the tension is forced and painful, but there are also some extremely normal relationship dynamics at play in Will and Summer\\'s relationship.The film does the balancing act of fantasy and reality quite well. If all rom-coms were brutally honest, we wouldn\\'t see many of them if any off the indie circuit. \"Definitely, Maybe\" is pretty much mostly sincere, however, and it\\'s mystery hook \\x97 though contrived \\x97 is sorta certainly the key to making it all work.~Steven CThanks for reading!

              " 'Hollywood is known for constantly dishing out the formulaic romantic comedy, at least nowadays. There was a time when these movies were good but they\\'ve since faded into obscurity. Fortunately I was surprised by this film which has been hailed as a \"romantic comedy.\" This is where the film becomes hated by most of the male demographic. The Holiday plays out like an \"indie dramedy\" right up until the last two minutes of the film, which plays very much like your standard romantic comedy.Luckily the rest of the film makes up for that. I won\\'t go into the details of the plot, you can read the synopsis on the IMDb page. But it\\'s definitely one of those films where you read the plot outline and think, \"It\\'s almost too simple to be this long of a movie,\" and yet the movie is filled with so much that one can relate to. Jude Law\\'s character was certainly a surprise, an honest and likable one at that. Cameron Diaz was actually really genuine as a cynic of love. Kate Winslet was a breathe of fresh air as a heartbroken soul trying to escape from her threesome of a relationship. And Jack Black, as short as his role was, was very likable as a romantic who is blinded by love. His Blockbuster scene definitely put a smile across my face, mainly because of the unexpected cameo.... To conclude, this film is barely your run of the mill romantic comedy from Hollywood; despite the ending and poor advertising that didn\\'t do the film any justice. There is also a lot of politics regarding the film industry. If you are a film buff, you\\'ll certainly appreciate one of the messages that this film is carrying. I\\'m more into independent films, but I figured on giving this movie a try and it was definitely worth the two hours. Take a holiday and enjoy this honest film about love and it\\'s heartbreaks. 8/10',\n",

It takes you along for a ride with a interesting and respectful metaphor about life. It tells a great story about a story-telling father and unbelieving son who don't know each other at all. Truth is that the stories his father tells are exaggerated but true but the son thinks their all complete blasphemy. He mostly tells of when he was young and in love with a girl he never met. He works as a circus janitor for information about the girl in which he receives from a family friend of hers. He is also the owner of the circus. All the actors and actresses do an amazing job and fit their roles perfectly. Tim Burton has now added this great film to his long list of glorious movies that he's been a part of.

Why do we not see visuals of naked, tortured children on television? Because nobody likes that! We see it with women all the time and it\\'s just unoriginal. Victimized woman, hero man. This is the most old, worn out plot there is. Where is the reality there? Where is the complexity of human emotions and actions and roles? As much as I love Woody, I found his acting strained.

Here is a sum of the women characters: victims, hookers, nagging wife, young mistress, useless poor, fat women to be questioned, and the de-sexualized black secretary.

City Lights tells the story of a tramp who by sheer luck befriends a drunken millionaire and falls in love with a blind young flower-girl. Both the people have different perceptions about the tramp \\x96 the millionaire only recognizes him when he is intoxicated while the girl mistakes him for a millionaire. In an effort to win the girl's heart and lighten her financial troubles, the tramp assumes the role of a millionaire, a street-sweeper and a boxer, but is mistaken by the others for a thief. The most striking part is that in one of the scenes, another desperate boxer flees from the restroom realizing that the cops are after him. But the tramp, who is the most honest and magnanimous person, is sent to jail. When the two lovers meet again, the girl, who has acquired sight with the money given by the tramp, offers him a nickel. Recall their first meeting when the tramp is the one who offers her a coin and we that the story has completed its cycle. The moment is so poignant that if one just looks at the tramp's eyes, he/she can see the various emotions experienced by him at that point.\\nThere are a few movies of Charlie Chaplin that will not work today because of the excessive slapstick in them. I remember being enervated by the abundance of butt-kicks in one of his old films that was close to unbearable. City Lights is not one of them, and here Charlie has blended slapstick, comedy, romance and drama seamlessly. The initial scenes when the tramp parties with the millionaire evokes not just humor but also pity for the tramp because we realize what may happen once the millionaire comes to his senses. We come to terms with the fact that there will be a moment when the tramp will not be aided by the millionaire and he would have to confess this to the blind girl. We still are in fits when the tramp, in fine clothes, cannot walk without slipping on those slippery floors, or when he begins eating spaghetti and takes the long strand of confetti in his mouth or the opening scene, where the tramp stomps on the private part of the statue and hangs by the sword while the anthem is going on. In the later scenes, we root for the clumsy, straggly man because we know how desperate he is. Every person, including the millionaire, the girl, her grandmother, the butler, the rich people and the tramp himself, have the human touch to them that is usually compromised in slapstick comedies.\\nCharlie Chaplin was the producer, director, actor, editor and music director of the film and everything is done by him immaculately. The loose body movements, the eccentric gait, the wide, expressive eyes and the sparkling comic timing are applaud worthy but what is most treasured is his ability to make the audience cry. Virginia Cherrill has terrific screen presence and can emote so well I was surprised to hear she wasn't in good terms with Charlie. Harry Myers gives us two sides of his personality in very believable terms; after his drinking bouts, when he gets up and sees Charlie, he has that perfect expression of confusion and weariness. Florence Lee is touching in her short role; Al Ernest Garcia as the butler who shows contempt towards the tramp shines. The two impish kids who sell newspapers, the prizefighter, the rich people, the two robbers etc are equally memorable.\\nThe Tramp gave everything, got nothing but did get his most cherished desire in the end. And we the audiences gave City Lights not even two hours and got one of the best experiences of our lives.\\nMy Rating: 10 out of 10\",\n",

              " 'I have no idea what movie the critics who panned it and the reviewers who rated it poorly were watching. I thought that the overall premise for Butterfly Effect was quite fascinating and very thought-provoking. We\\'ve all thought about how the decisions we\\'ve made have shaped our lives, and how if we could go back and change some of them, how they would change our lives. That said, I fail to understand how anyone watching this film failed to at least identify with the basis of it. And many have been quick to say that it was unbelievable because they had three different actors playing the parts of each of the characters, one for age 7, age 13, and the adult versions. The child actors they cast not only looked exactly like the adult versions, but they put in some excellent little acting jobs as well. That said, we\\'ll move on to the biggest reason many people did not give this movie a fair chance. Ashton. How can we take a guy who said, \"Dude, sweet!\" numerous times in a movie seriously? Quite easily. He put in an impressive acting job here. Not only was he convincing, but he proved he can hang in dramatic roles. Every big actor started somewhere. Jim Carrey wasn\\'t always a blockbuster actor. He did some horrible 80s movies like \"Earth Girls Are Easy\" and went on to do a few silly movies. But he also did some very serious, drama-based roles, some of which have been pretty ballsy and creative. \"The Truman Show\", still one of my favorite Peter Weir movies, was an incredible piece of social commentary. And then there\\'s \"Man On The Moon.\" Johnny Depp has taken some odd roles in his career, and continues to do so. His unique choices for roles are what has shaped him as an actor. Every single big time actor has paid his dues. \"Dude Where\\'s My Car\" and \"Just Married\" were stepping stones. They served as vehicles in order to allow Ashton to move on to something meatier. Or maybe it was just that too many people don\\'t feel like going to a movie and having to think in order to understand it. Look at \"Fight Club\" and \"Memento.\" Two very serious movies that required some very serious thought and attention to fully understand and appreciate, but both of which are tremendous pieces of cinema art. That said, if you\\'re looking for something intense, suspenseful, and possibly a bit thought-provoking, give \"Butterfly Effect\" a chance. It hardly disappoints.',\n",
              " '8 Mile is the movie that is somewhat based on the life of Eminem. It is about young man, Jimmy Smith Jr. also known as \"Rabbit\" who is played by Eminem, that is striving to be better and break away from the dead end that he is living in. He has grown up in Detroit in the poor (black) side of town. He dreams of being a rapper, but ends up choking when battling it out at the local night club. In hopes of being able to record an album, Rabbit moves in with his alcoholic mother, Stephanie Smith, played by Kim Basinger, in order to save some money. Rabbit ends up meeting Alex, played by Brittany Murphy, and things start to take a turn for the better. When Rabbit finds out that Alex is not faithful to him, it really pushes him to be the best that he can be with his rapping. He finally finds the courage to stand up and battle it out at the night club.I think that the Director did a great job with the lighting throughout the movie. The movie was shot in low key lighting that really helped to give a sense of the anger, fear, agony, and confusion that rabbit was dealing with in the movie, along with making Detroit seem more believable. A lot of the angles of the camera were close ups throughout the film, and this really helped us to see the changes that were taking place in Rabbit throughout the movie. In the beginning of the movie he was filled with a lot of fear, but in the end of the movie you could see that he had learned to break through that fear and succeed. One of the turning points for Rabbit breaking through his fear was when he was talking with Alex, and she told him that she believed in him. Sometimes that is all a person needs is someone to believe in them.There have been a lot of movies similar to this one like Get Rich or Die Trying and Save the last Dance that deal with similar themes of over coming obstacles and fear in your life. I think this movie really does a good job in portraying, that in order to succeed in life you just have to believe in yourself and work hard. There will always be obstacles that will try to to drag you down, but you have to have the courage to prevail.',\n",
              " 'The Wolf of Wall Street ReviewScorsese\\'s The Wolf of Wall Street is probably one of the most gruesome yet enjoyable movies ever screened; film critic Matt Zoller Seitz even said it was \"one of the most entertaining films ever made about loathsome men\" (Seitz). That is the perfect quote to introduce what should be the general consensus for this movie: it was disturbingly fantastic. This movie contained a myriad of inappropriate scenes including drug use of a long lost drug (now banned by the United States government) called \"Quaaludes\". Aside from the main characters Jordan Belfort and his friend Donnie popping Quaaludes almost every other scene, viewers also see the use of cocaine, alcohol consumption, prostitution, and explicit language. The movie probably goes a maximum of five minutes without seeing any one of those activities occur, which is why I use the word \"disturbingly\" to modify how fantastic the movie was. However, many people just saw the gruesome activities in the movie and could not look past them and see the main details of the film. A lot of people bought tickets to The Wolf of Wall Street expecting something completely different than what they got. When they viewed the movie, it seems all they saw was the inappropriate drug use, prostitution, explicit language, etc. Lou Lumenick of the New York Post wrote \"If you\\'re going to invest three hours watching a movie about a convicted stock swindler, it needs to be a whole lot more compelling than Martin Scorsese\\'s handsome, sporadically amusing and admittedly never boring \\x97 but also bloated, redundant, vulgar, shapeless and pointless \\x97 Wolf of Wall Street\" (Lumenick). Lumenick seems to represent a large consensus of average reviewers who thought The Wolf of Wall Street was overblown and redundant at most parts. But what these viewers failed to see in this movie was the fact that it is NOT about Wall Street alone. It is actually an account of the life of Jordan Belfort, who even wrote a book which was the inspiration for this movie. Belfort\\'s book described his life of lavish partying and addiction to Quaaludes, which was the inspiration for the heavy use of them in this movie. It is unfortunate many people cannot see that the plot of this movie is centered on the man Jordan Belfort and that they expect to see a more detailed account of what it is like to be a broker on Wall Street. Maybe they need to start being more realistic and stop judging books by their covers because The Wolf of Wall Street is much more than a nearly three hour fun-fest of drugs, sex, and swindling money from people. It is an actual account of the life of Jordan Belfort, whom Leonardo DiCaprio depicted beautifully. His acting was exquisite, and the style he did it with was beautiful. He acted with an intensity and passion that any DiCaprio fan would expect. But going back to the original point: despite being packed with all the gruesome activity, the movie was overall fascinating and well worth the 179-minute viewing. Yes, it is quite long, but it is so detailed that it is nearly impossible to get bored at any point during the movie. The movie gets so detailed at certain points that viewers are able to delve into Belfort\\'s initial thoughts when he meets his good friend Donnie Azoff. The fact that the movie included the thoughts on Jordan regarding Donnie\\'s teeth is kind of incredible because it is an extreme type of detail which no other director would be able to make work. Scorsese\\'s work in this movie was top notch, comparable to many of his other highly regarded films, like Taxi Driver and Gangs of New York. Oh and by the way, Taxi Driver included a highly controversial role of an underage prostitute played by Jodie Foster, yet it received several Oscar nominations. So for those critics who disagree with Scorsese adding all the use of prostitution in The Wolf of Wall Street, just look back to Taxi Driver. He made it work then, and he has made it work again. So despite many people being so opposed to the highly inappropriate aspects of The Wolf of Wall Street, it is pretty obvious that all anyone has to do is look past the title of the movie and set real expectation for this movie. From there, this movie is nothing but fantastic. The Wolf of Wall Street deserves nothing but praise for its accurate depiction of Jordan Belfort\\'s life, but mostly for its extreme attention to detail and its ability to never get boring. David Thomson of New Republic described it perfectly: \"This is a film by Martin Scorsese, not just the funniest he has ever made but the first in which there is an authentic daring\" (Thomson). The Wolf of Wall Street is a film that deserves high praise and recognition.',\n",
              " 'A worthy successor to Jurassic Park. Fares much better than the other sequels but lacks the story and character depth of the original masterpiece as well as the its killer suspense. The performances are solid and the direction is decent but a little generic.It however makes up for it with great special effects, fantastic action sequences and an immense amount of bloody dino carnage. At times it can be a bit much but it holds together fairly well and culminates to a ferocious finale that left the audience screaming and clapping. A solid summer thrill ride that does a great job of reinvigorating the franchise but the best advice i can give the makers of the unavoidable follow up is too slow it down a bit. Anticipation makes the proceedings that much more effective.',\n",

The atmosphere, the music, the acting, that gut-wrenching finale.....what a movie!!!!!

              " 'There was a lot of uncertainty and speculation when the actor to take the coveted James Bond role was revealed. Admittedly, I was one of the doubters but, after witnessing Daniel Craig\\'s immaculate performance in the new movie Casino Royale, I was proved wrong.The first blonde Bond gave the sophisticated, witty and arrogant performance expected of Britain\\'s most famous secret agent. Dare I say it, the role was played as well, if not better, than his predecessor Pierce Brosnan, and the film was ten times better than the previous instalment, Die Another Day.The script was cleverly structured, the twists in the storyline were far less predictable, the brilliant ending tied up the film very neatly, and Craig injected some very humorous lines into the dialogue. When asked how he would prefer his Martini prepared, instead of the traditional \"Shaken, not stirred\", this time Bond replied \"Do I look like I give a damn?\" Unlike many of the previous movies, the emphasis of Casino Royale was less on the cars and car chases, Bond girls and gadgets, but more on the story and characters. And yes, as rumours suggested, James Bond did drive a Ford Mondeo. Classy.Of course, the Mondeo was later traded in for a flashy Aston Martin DB9, fully equipped with all the classic Bond gadgets and gizmos. The only disappointment came when, just as Craig set off in his new toy on a long-awaited car chase, he proceeded to skid off the road and write it off in a spectacular fashion. The only equipment from the fully stocked Aston that Bond put to good use was a medikit to keep him alive after being drugged by his arch nemesis in a poker game.However, the positives in Casino Royale far outweighed the negatives. All the characters were acted brilliantly, in particular Bond girl Vesper Lynd, played by actress Eva Green. Vesper wasn\\'t a typical Bond girl \\x96 she actually developed a meaningful relationship with the secret agent, as oppose to the traditional one night stand. The role was played with the quick wit and sophistication unseen from previous lead female characters.As always, not a fault could be picked with the performance of Bond film veteran Judi Dench as Craig\\'s boss, M.I have never been a big fan of Bond, but I haven\\'t seen such a cleverly scripted, action-packed film in a long time. I was extremely impressed with the new movie, and expect Daniel Craig to play the character many more times in years to come. He certainly proved the critics wrong.9/10',\n",
              " 'I have watched this movie several times and still find it to be the funniest thing I\\'ve ever seen on film. In fact, I think I laugh harder every time I see it.Richard Dreyfuss and Bill Murray will have you rolling on the floor as this movie progresses. Dreyfuss is Dr. Leo Marvin, a widely respected psychiatrist whose fame is spreading after writing a best selling book about therapy, while Murray is Bob Wylie, an extremely neurotic new patient who is afraid of life itself and who can\\'t let go of his new doctor, even after Dr. Marvin goes on vacation. The supporting cast (which includes Julie Hagerty as Dr. Marvin\\'s wife, Fay) is solid, but the movie really revolves around Dreyfuss and Murray.The most impressive thing about their performances is the way in which they are able to flawlessly \"exchange roles\" in a sense. Beginning with Dreyfuss as the completely focused psychiatrist and Murray as the unbelievably crazy neurotic, over the course of the movie the roles change, with Dreyfuss ending up as the insane one and Murray as the normal one. It\\'s fascinating (and funny) to watch Dreyfuss portray Dr. Marvin slowly slipping away, while Murray is perhaps even more subtle in showing the changes in Bob - changes that become obvious by the end of the movie.In short, this is great comedy, and features two superb performances from two fine actors. It is indeed - in my opinion at least - the perfect comedy. I rate it as a 10/10. If you\\'re having a rough day, rent this. You\\'ll feel better.',\n",

In general, I didn\\'t mind some obvious logical flaws like \"\\x85a blind guy can\\'t do this or that\\x85\" But what I did mind was the irritating way the movie wanted to make a statement about the importance of the bible. Until the first three thirds of the movie were over, I did not know what the film wanted to tell me so desperately. Is the bible a dangerous book that mankind simply fails to understand or is it so valuable that one must save it even by completely pervert its content? Later on, the second interpretation seemed plausible as Eli did not turn the other cheek but cut off the whole hand and I was looking forward to more sublime black humor In the end I was completely confused by the message it obviously tried to get across. \"The bible is a super important and wonderful book\" just makes no sense in context of this movie. I would suggest reading the New Testament before writing a story about the bible. It wasn\\'t a waste of time, it just made me angry. But nonetheless 5/10 for wonderful art direction!',\n",
              " 'First I must say, that, although a Potter-fan I am, I have not found the other movies pretty good. Harry Potter is a book series, a piece meant to be literature. That makes it a hard one to make into a good movie... and finally someone at least tries.Not since the third installation of Potter series have I left the theater playing Harry Potter movie with such an satisfaction. The direction was superb. Angles and images roared in with a vision; the magic world was executed magically, still without becoming a meaningless blur of overwhelming effects. Also, the script was full of wit and intention. For once they had managed to understand, that adapting a book means different than copying the book word-to-word. They were very brave of altering the holy word of Rowling\\'s, but in eight of ten cases, the effort payed off. The effects never take the grand stage, unless in the final grand combat between Dumbledore and You-Know-Who. I would have rather seen a Gandalf/Saruman -style magic battle. I remind you that the really great magicians don\\'t need to explode everything and throw fire bolts from their fingers. Otherwise, the images were almost too beautiful to see and the musical score rocked.The story of this one is tighter than usually, which helped to carry on with the narrative. Some important character stuff was cut out anyway, which is never such a good thing, but much less in here than in the \"Harry Potter and the Flaming Goblet\". I would have wished to see more of the Weasley family, at least the running away of Percy, and Umbridge\\'s attempt to capture Hagrid. Also, the \"fights\" between Harry and his school mates didn\\'t really feel so enraged than in the book to that extent, that we almost don\\'t understand Harry when he says that he feels anger almost all the time. Also, the bit where Harry invades Snape\\'s memory seemed kinda fake. Also, in the beginning the dialog doesn\\'t work very well.About the characters/actors: Gary Oldman steals the show as Sirius Black. Finally little more screen time for him. Also Alan Rickman and Helena Bonham-Carter make a brilliant job with their rather small roles. Stauton as Umbridge doesn\\'t hit the mark all that well, she is rather \"amusing\" than evil and twisted. She doesn\\'t look like Umbridge, and she doesn\\'t act like her. But all the children have evolved as actors, even Daniel Ratcliffe, with his notable performance as the Defence Against Dark Arts teacher. Cho Chang was good, and so were Maggie Smith and Robbie Coltrane, but rather trivially used. Filtch became a very good comic relief. And the one character I was certain would not work, Luna Lovegood, was absolutely spot-on perfect. Unfortunately, Voldemort and Dementors still aren\\'t scary and Mad-Eye Moody still doesn\\'t quite work, but those are the faults caused by the previous movie makers.This is my humble opinion. I don\\'t understand those, who didn\\'t appreciate David Yates\\' work and the changes that he made, all to make the movie a better experiment. I am honestly expecting the next movie almost as much as the final novel. Well, I did say almost.',\n",

This flashes back a forth about 7 times and like I said quite annoying. Random slow motion walks are also incorporated which seems like its been too over used in movies over the years. I know im not the only one who seen similarities between this film and and Pulp Fiction but the most striking thing that I cant believe they didn't leave on the cutting room floor was a scene where the same two men I talked about earlier are about to rape one, two and just in time an entourage of Lenny's men walk in just before the deed is done. But don't get me wrong this is a pretty good movie Toby Kebbell stole the show with his perfect depiction of hardcore drug addict. Fantastic actor Tom Wilkinson is also great in yet another film thanks to his comic wit. Its even pretty damn funny at some moments.

At no point in this film did I stop and think \"Hey, this isn\\'t that bad\" because it was the absolute opposite. I would genuinely rather watch my relatives have an orgy in a bathtub full of pureed zucchini than ever lay eyes on this film again. The scene where the teenage girls rob the fast food store with plastic guns and sledgehammers is ridiculous as any grown human within that establishment would have wiped the floors with their wigs instead of handing over money and wallets. Their further reinforcement of their great achievement is one of the early signs of repetition that will make you want body slam a floor full of Lego. The acting and lack thereof was completely atrocious and unrealistic. Rachel Korine\\'s sandals in the promotional poster were almost enough to convince me not to watch this film. A friend (as a joke) suggested that we should watch it and absorb the wonderful acting, plot, and directing. I celebrated when Korine was shot and was no longer present within the film. Selena Gomez did herself a favor and exited while the opportunity was there, but I thoroughly enjoyed when she encouraged her grandmother to join her in sleeping with strangers, snorting cocaine off of fat people and drinking more alcohol than her geriatric liver could probably handle. Shall I even continue onto James Franco\\'s character? Apparently he only took the role for his friend, the directer which was a poor decision. His transformation made him look like a Caucasian Snoop Dogg recently defecated from the rectum of Vanilla Ice. His accent made me want to funnel warm fecal matter into my eyes. If I ever hear the phrase \"Sprang Break Fa-Eva\" one more time, so help me God, I will burn everything in my sight. His boasting of possessions such as Calvin Klein Escape (which literally smells like rectal leakage) in conjunction with seductively sucking on a gun silencer was probably the most cringe-worthy part of the entire film (paedophilic orgy in the pool aside). His rendition of Britney Spears\\' Every time was almost the breaking point and is up there with the top five most painful scenes that I have ever endured in a film. His accomplices, the twin males, were a completely unnecessary addition to the already flaming pile of horse excrement that is this film. The final confrontation (if you can even call it that) between Gucci Mane and Alien was short lived as Alien was killed almost instantaneously. The two remaining adolescent females with zero arms experience manage to miraculously murder an entire house full of gangsters without even reloading. To call the film as a whole garbage is a compliment. The soundtrack was mediocre at best and the repetition of redundant scenes from the beginning of the film (which weren\\'t even necessary the first time round) was a poor decision.

He meets Summer Finn (the quintessential Indie actor, Zooey Deschanel), a mercurial waif of sorts, who only wants to have a 'casual' relationship. Not only does Tom put Summer on a pedestal but the screenwriters do as well\\x97we find out next to nothing about her except for the fact that she believes that Ringo was the greatest Beatle and she's willing to pattern some of her behavior in the bedroom based on a porno tape the couple has rented.In short, Tom is guilty of puppy dog love\\x97and it's the examination of his obsession that we're forced to watch for about an hour and a half. One wonders what Tom sees in Summer but that doesn't really concern the film's scenarists. We're treated to a series of gimmicky 'fantasy' sequences that chronicle Tom's mood changes as his relationship with Summer begins to deteriorate.In the beginning, after he makes love to Summer for the first time, he's out on the streets, leading a huge crowd of people in song and dance, accompanied by a marching band. Then there are nods to the great film directors such as Fellini (Summer and Tom are now characters in their own version of 'La Dolce Vita') and Bergman (Tom becomes the brooding Knight in a takeoff on the famous playing chess with Death scene). As things get bad, a split screen displays Tom's expectations and 'reality', when the feuding lovebirds attend a party together. Finally, at his darkest moment, Tom morphs into a fading pencil drawn figure against an animated background.'Summer' aims at some comic relief as the Greeting Card company that Tom and Summer work at are populated with quirky characters who always are trying to come up with new pithy sayings for the wacky greeting cards they're attempting to compose. Also in the mix are Tom's two best friends who appear to have less than stellar love lives. Perhaps the least humorous of the comic relief is Tom's younger sister, who occasionally pops up and offers obnoxious advice about dating etiquette.Tom eventually overcomes his depression over losing Summer by quitting his job at the greeting card company and going on job interviews at architectural firms, where he seeks to pursue his life-long job working at a 'legitimate' job as an architect. As for Summer, Tom is confused by her sudden decision not to pursue 'casual' relationships anymore, and get married.'500 Days' has a very nice look to it and its witty pop culture reference will keep your interest. But in the end, it has little to offer in terms of appealing to the intellect. Do we really care about Summer, a cipher of a character who's put on a pedestal ? And what's so captivating about Tom's obsession and decline into depression? If you're looking for escapist entertainment to pass some time, '500 Days' fits the bill. But ultimately, I doubt that this film will be remembered in the coming years as a romantic comedy classic, or even remembered at all.\",\n",
              " \"Before Brad Bird found success with The Incredibles and Ratatouille, he directed this little seen film, The Iron Giant. Bird is one of the true auteur's of modern animation. Despite only three films to his name, the man is quite simply a genius. His films represent the finest examples of family entertainment. Ones that appeal to adults and children alike. And he understands what makes a film accessible to a child. You don't talk down to them. Just talk to them.The Iron Giant was given a curious lack of advertising by Warner Bros. It was just dumped into cinemas with very little advance notice. And not surprisingly, The Iron Giant did next to no business. And that is a real shame. Because its one of the greatest animated films you will ever see.Taking a leaf out of ET's book, and based on the short story by Ted Hughes, The Iron Giant follows the tale of a 100-foot robot that crashes to Earth in Rockwell, Maine, 1957. Bird has deliberately set the film in Cold War America. In fact the setting is just days after the Russians launched the Sputnik satellite. So the atmosphere is expectedly tense and paranoid. Most Americans of that era thought anyone who wasn't a member of the USA was their enemy. And its unfortunate The Iron Giant should have to land on Earth during such a dark era.Hogarth Hughes is a schoolboy obsessed with the stars. He watches all the classic B-movies. Collects all the comics. Has posters of Forbidden Planet proudly displayed on the walls of his bedroom. But when the TV goes on the blink one night, Hogarth goes outside and investigates. Their antenna has been bitten off the roof. Someone has left a trail of destruction behind them. Cars. Wagons. And when Hogarth follows them, he comes across The Iron Giant.When Hogarth saves him from being electrocuted at a power plant, the two become fast friends. Hogarth sort of adopts him, and has to go to great lengths to conceal him from the outside world. No easy task considering his insatiable appetite for metal. And when a government agent comes snooping around, it isn't long before war breaks out between the townspeople of Rockwell and the innocent Iron Giant.Anyone who hasn't seen this film must go out and buy it immediately. Because you are missing out on one of the most perfect family films ever conceived. Brad Bird never puts a foot wrong. He strikes the perfect balance between comedy, action and touching sentiment. Its a film where you never feel like you're being patronised or lectured to.Although ET did spring to mind while I was watching this film (and Bird has worked with Steven Spielberg in the past), I think The Iron Giant is far superior. ET felt (to me anyway) like a calculated attempt on Spielberg's part to push all the right emotional buttons at perfectly timed intervals. I never felt any manipulation during The Iron Giant.Bird crafts the friendship between Hogarth and his new friend with surprising sophistication. Hogarth's attempts to humanise the machine is conducted with real skill and expertise. Since Hogarth knows they're living in dangerous times, he knows exactly how the people will react if they saw The Iron Giant. They'll only see a monster. Something alien. And in they're minds, anything that's alien must be destroyed.Bird also does a great job evoking the atmosphere of 1950's Cold War America. The film has many accurate details that will immediately strike a chord with anyone of that era. Such as the disturbing Duck and Cover programmes. And Bird makes sure the fear and uncertainty of the times are neatly represented too. Like paranoid conspiracy nuts and straight arrow Army Generals.But the crux of the film is Hogarth's friendship with The Iron Giant. The way these two outsiders find a friend in each other. The film gets a lot of mileage out of the different adventures they get up to. Whether it be slapstick, like Hogarth doing a cannonball into a lake, and when the Giant tries it, he ends up draining all the water. Or sentiment, like when Hogarth discovers what the Giant really is.The film has a very strong anti-gun statement to make. None more so than the scene when the pair come across a deer in the woods shot by hunters. Hogarth makes a very impassioned speech about how its wrong to kill. And how to make the right choice.Its genuinely shocking to discover the Giant is a weapon. His crash to Earth has robbed him of that knowledge. But his programming kicks in whenever he feels threatened. Something not helped by the Army coming to take this 'monster' down.The Iron Giant has to make a choice between being a gun, and being a person. Which will he choose? Or will his programming make the choice for him? Pretty heady material for a so-called kids film.Brad Bird has a clear love of retro futurism, something he lavishly displayed in The Incredibles, and here too. The Iron Giant is a tall, galumphing behemoth. But Bird does a great job making him seem endearing, especially with a surprisingly animated metal face. And the different weaponry inside of him is pretty inventive too. He's got more add-ons than the Swiss Army!Things come to a very moving conclusion when the Giant must sacrifice himself for Hogarth and the people who hate him. Its very saddening, and will leave you feeling depressed for days afterwards. Odd to feel such compassion for an animated character isn't it?The Iron Giant is an unforgettable experience. One of the finest animated movies ever made. And all the more remarkable for having the ability to move and enchant you as much as it does.\",\n",
              " \"I usually do not commit myself to any serial because experience tells me that most of the serials, specially the American ones (compared to British serials not Indians!!!), tend to extend the episodes unnecessarily. They start with exciting beginning seasons and becomes dull or absurd with time. That's why I watch serials that are out a while ago and those having a definite end in sight and those which are highly recommended. Stranger Things has all three of these and so I started and finished watching this with utter disappointment. I have pointed out some of my sources of disappointment below, there are more, but I am not willing to spend any more time on this:1. The storyline is a clich√©, may be it would have been a good storyline (though I doubt) if it originally were made in the '80s. Controlling things with mind, aliens, secret government experiments are all so things of the past in the entertainment world. 2. Acting was horrible and full of overacting. I particularly hated the acting of Winona Ryder. 3. Trying to sell tragedy so hard. Chief Hopper's dead daughter, Joyce's broken family and finally death of Eleven gives me the feel of watching something oriental. On the other hand, poor Barbara's family does not seem to have any concern for their daughter or whatever she was. 4. It does not make sense why the Government tried to sell a staffed doll as a dead body rather than just terming it a lost case and again no one bothered about missing Barbara the same way as they did about Will. 5. Three teenage kid managed to handle the monster with relative ease whereas the well-armed government agents are decimated by the same thing does not make any sense or reminds me of bullshit movie plots. 6. And many more. Finally, I started watching the series with higher expectation because of its high recommendation and because I expected better from a Netflix series, and this did not help either.\",\n",

So why in the hell is this worth our time? The action. The fight scenes in this yarn scale from average to excellent. No Crouching Tiger, but for a videogame adaptation they're not bad.This movie also made Paul W.S. Anderson the director he is today. There are mixed feelings.

              " 'This is really a great movie, I loved the story and the atmosphere. Wonderful acting, true characters. I especially enjoyed Billy`s dad - having lost his wife he is left alone with his sons and his mother, obviously not able to deal with his life, nevertheless always being the \"strong\" man of the family. And men do NOT go to \"bally\" lessons ! I would have given Billy Elliott a 8/10 if it wasn`t for the pathetic ending. #MAJOR SPOILERS# In my opinion, the film should have ended when Billy entered the bus, finally going to London to have dancing lessons. But somehow the director felt it was necessary to show Billys first stage performance (this is ten years later). Besides the fact that the older Billy is not resembling the younger Billy at all, the movie does not leave you with a fantasy about what could become of Billy or his family. Instead, you see his father and brother come to London (you wonder - where does all the money for this trip suddenly come from ? They wear good clothes etc.). The friend of his teen years who enjoyed wearing his mothers dresses and had a crush on Billy (wonderful performance !) is now, 10 years later sitting next to Billys father, wearing a woman`s hat. Unfortunately, this scene does not keep in line with the subtle, intelligent storytelling we enjoyed throughout the film - but is a rather \"straight in your face - notice this guy is gay in 3 seconds before this movie is over\" scene. A few seconds less would have made Billy Elliott an almost perfect movie.',\n",

It had so much potential that was just thrown away by $250 million. The film begins with a full Avengers action scene, but the action falls short of the standard that you would see from other Marvel films like Iron Man or Avengers Assemble, it's just a bit all over the place. The story also follows suit, the story twists and developed characters that you see in DC films are gold dust compared to the development of characters and story in this. But it does have it's up sides, there are quite a few good jokes that'll keep you happy and good CGI for some eye candy.\",\n",

Dangal gives you a peek in to people's lives who have a commitment towards sport and passionate towards nation but also the problems they face while they fulfill their dreams. Entire cast Aamir, Sakshi, Fatima, Saanya, Zaira and Suhani did an excellent job and justice to their roles. Needless to say Aamir excels to do what he is good at and keeps you occupied with his intense acting. The female leads (especially the younger and older Geeta) were awesome in their roles when it comes to the tackle scenes be it in the mud or on the turf. The camera work capturing fights in the bout needs a special mention here as they stand out and gives you a treat of a real combat between two wrestlers. For those who saw the trailers multiple times the first half is an easy guess about what happens next, but otherwise the movie is excellent piece of work by the entire crew of Dangal. Full marks to the Director, Aamir and his girls.\",\n",
              " 'To comment on this movie, there are two main sides: First one would be Adam Sandler, I have always liked his movies, for the light kind of comedy he presents, you watch and you laugh but you don\\'t expect to come out of the movie with a deeper message or something remotely philosophic to think about, I find that when Adam Sandler tries to go deep, his movies become quite depressing and nonsensical, \"Click\" quickly comes to mind.The thing about the Zohan, is that I laughed a lot in some parts, but I find his affairs with the older ladies to be a bit repetitive and leaning towards downright BORING. Also the crude language and the oh-too-much \"crotch\" view makes it quite impossible to let your kids watch the movie, which is a pity, because I find the hilarious fight scenes and the Zohan\\'s \"supernatural\" cool stunts would have been fun for kids to watch.Second point of view would be from an Arab point of view; I started watching this movie, preparing myself to get offended, and mind you I am a very broad minded person ... However, I was pleasantly surprised, for the first time in my life I see a movie that does not picture Arabs as animal-like, heartless, brainless killing machines. They are just people, trying to make a living, even the avenging one has a reason, the Zohan stole his goat.Watching this movie, I tried to forget that I am an Arab, and I see that it is portraying - in a very silly and somehow inaccurate way - two opposing sides, and suggesting that they stop fighting, get over their differences to see that they are in fact similar.The movie makers get my personal \"thank you\" for that, it is no different than watching a movie about the conflict between \"black\" and \"white\" people after the civil war, or about Americans and Japanese directly after WWII, there is no prejudices against Arabs here.For the very first time, someone has discovered that Arabs are human beings too.

Him and along with two other guys are in a raft for 47days. During this time WWII is going on, Between the Japanese and the USA. Soon after the Men are captured by the enemies and sent to a prisoner camp. There Louis has to go through challenges to survive while the War is going on.I believe that the film was put together really well, it made it look really well. That a war was actually going on and the sadness and torture with the prisoners. The Director was Angelina Jolie I think that the actors were great in the movie. It was like they were actually the person and not acting. For Louis, His acting was just perfect and one point, the way he seem like he was in pain and anger. And how skinny he looked. For Watanabe, He was great as the general. It was believable that he was angry and vicious to the prisoners It was understandable because all of that has happened before. People are taken hostage to work. I didn't see the beginning of the movie so I don't know about the flash backs. It looked very realistic, with the mountains, Water, Trees. Everything looked so real in the background. Their Costumes couldn't be any better. They looked like real soldiers, prisoners, and guards. The music made everything all dramatic and sad. So that it went along with the story. It helped to show how much sadness there was in that camp, Also agony and anger. I believe that the movie was just right, the length. Because it shows the time period of when they were captured so you know what they experienced there. I didn't like it how in the movie the guy in the raft wanted to die so they tied him up and he drowned. It also made no sense of how when the raft got shot multiple times that the raft didn't sink all the way. Because there were many bullet holes. Those two men in the raft should've been dead. I wouldn't say 13 and up. Because no little kids should watch this movie, because of the violence and how the men are treated. I would give the movie 4 Stars. The reasoning why is yes it was a great movie but some things in it were questioning.\",\n",

They should have just called the movie \"Super Jew vs The Hill-Mutants\". No racism intended, but the camera did seem to focus a lot on the Star of David the guy was wearing and the guy got beat down harder then one of Mike Tyson\\'s punching bags. I don\\'t know. I went with a group of people and we were laughing at the movie more then we were frightened by it. Even audience members were laughing at parts that weren\\'t \"supposed to be funny\". When a DOG started kicking more butt then the actual characters, I started to get that \"this is corny\" feeling.Too each their own, of course. I just thought the movie was way too predictable for my liking. I swear on anything, I was calling what was going to happen next to the point where the people behind us asked me to please not spoil the movie for them. I\\'VE HAD NOT EVEN SEEN THE MOVIE! The old or new version. It just seemed like your typical horror movie where you\\'re screaming \"WHAT THE %^)# ARE YOU DOING?!?\" at the screen. At parts I was actually getting mad because the characters were stupid, even for a horror movie. For some reason it REALLY reminded me of the \"Texas Chainsaw Massacre\" remake. I thought I was the only one, until I heard three or four other people walking out of the theater saying the same thing.I don\\'t know guys. I was greatly disappointed. I was so excited to see this movie and I guess I was just extremely let down.

You always feel like, \"Will is hunting deer. Will\\'s dog just died, etc.\" Also, is it written into his contracts that he has to flash his physique in EVERY film he does? Yuck.There\\'s nothing really creepy about the mutants,or whatever they are, in this film. \"Omega Man\" was wonderfully creepy/cheesy with it\\'s sentient mutants. The mutants in this film look very similar to those in \"The Descent\" (Another superior film), especially when they converge on the Stale Prince\\'s lair in the end. Reminiscent of the scene where Juno is set upon by hordes of the cave mutants.Really boring, and there just seems to be no purpose to the characters of Ana and Ethan. Too many plot holes to enable you to suspend reality, and a typical Hollywood ending. \"Waterworld\" did post-apocalyptic much better than this, even if it was something of a dog.Save your money for \"28 Days Later/28Weeks Later\", or \"Dawn of The Dead\", if you like movies of this genre.

It\\'s presented like a real \\'70s film in a documentary-like style that takes its time in getting to the climax. Certainly having such worthy support from John Goodman, Alan Arkin, and Bryan Cranston contributes immensely to the compelling drama of the situation and Affleck\\'s direction doesn\\'t seem false in presenting the way things happened during that tense time though I\\'m sure some liberties were taken. So on that note, Argo is recommended as a historical docudrama. P.S. Loved seeing many of the vintage news footage including one from ABC saying a late night rerun of \"The Love Boat\" will be delayed for 15 minutes for Ted Koppel\\'s report on the latest Iranian development. That would eventually become \"Nightline\". Oh, and this was the second time I watched a movie with the \\'70s version of the Warner Bros. logo presented this year.

If the magic tablet gives everyone the ability to speak Modern American English, then Atilla should, too. It is somewhat plausible however, that the cave men might not possess the capacity of language. And why does Jedediah have a \"cowboy\" accent? By that reasoning, Lancelot should use ye olde English. By the way, Lancelot is probably the most good and noble knight in Aurthurian Legend. He only had one failing, which was his adulterous affair with Guinevere. The Lancelot in this movie is more like Mordred. This is because he has modern Eurocentric values mixed in with his \"historic\" values. This was somewhat tolerable with the previously mentioned Jedediah in the first two movies having a mix of modern and historical values, but it was both unnecessary and overwhelming to have ALL the new \"historical\" characters have this dual nature.

From there she creates a mystical fantasy that transports you into her problem solving world that answers the problems she faces in the distant but harsh \"real\" world.A fascinating ride for those who get it.

I came into the movie uninfluenced by the good reviews it naturally gets, but it was still to no avail. Here's my beef:First, Boogie Nights tried to hard to have that deep message about how a life of moral decadence leads to regret and a general waste of innocence. We all know this, we all think about how empty the dirty stripper is on the inside. Second, I have no beef with Anderson, it's just that his cinematography was so over the top. I fully understand that he has the capability to make long shots on tracks, cranes, dollies or with a steady cam, but not every single shot has to be a long shot. I don't want a porno version of Raging Bull. Third, Burt Reynolds really didn't deserve an Oscar nomination for his role. It was a good character, but not nomination worthy. The only thing he deserves is the Awesome Mustache Trophy Fourth, this movie gets so much damn praise from people. I can't figure out why. I think it's the classic ideology that something risqu√© has to be good. This movie is over inflated because of the type of content (in this case, the pornographic type) in Boogie Nights instead of the quality of the content (which was weak). Fifth, this movie was filled with too many 70's stereotypes. It was overdone. Sixth, Mark Wahlberg's acting wasn't that great. It was subpar at best. I'll give it him on that he was good in the scene recording his album because it was pretty funny. Regardless, he was too dramatic and and over worked the nonchalant attitude of his character. Seventh, too many useless characters. I love William H. Macy, but his character was useless. I'm indifferent on Phillip Seymour Hoffman, but he too was useless. Eighth, this movie had that feel where if you keep waiting patiently, it will get better. It never did. I hate when movies do that. Ninth, I personally think the writing for this movie was unimaginative and boring. Such a clich√© story, boy goes on his own, boy makes porn and becomes rich and famous, boy finds drugs and hits the gutter, boy finds his way back to glory. Seen it before, let's write something new. Tenth, too many useless side stories. If Anderson would have completely cut out the black guy making it in the stereo business with stolen money, Phillip Seymour Hoffman's homosexual journey, Luis Guzman's club adventures and William H. Macy's marital frustrations and this movie might have been somewhat less aimless.Overall 2.3 out of 10.\",\n",

Unfortunately, even today these prejudices exist. And the helpless, distraught look on Tom's face after being let down for the tenth time by another prejudiced lawyer is heart wrenching. The court room scenes are the highlight of the movie. The cruel, cold-hearted treatment Tom Hanks is subjected to is a lesson for all of us on the need to be sensitive to others state of mind. But even today, even when we all know who is guilty and who is innocent, we still need to prove it in the court of law. Having a supportive family is good, but we live in a society and we also need them to accept us for our distinct nature and individualism. Slowly, Denzel realizes that he is not just fighting for a law that has been broken, a lot more than the law has been broken and that is what he is fighting for.The songs at the beginning and ending of the movie are aptly worded and sung to perfection.All in all a beautiful, sensitive movie and a path breaking one too.\",\n",

I understand why he (when I use he, I\\'m referring to the director) was doing it like this, to create a feeling of anxiety and intensity, but like many things, its WAY overdone. He certainly had good intentions, \"drugs are bad\" and all that, but the way he did it kind of felt blunt and cold like a drugs class at school. I couldn\\'t really relate personally with the sorrows of the main characters, and most of the arguments he presents seem to argue more for legalization of drugs than not doing them. It seems that most of their problems would have been solved merely by a more accepting open-minded societal outlook towards drugs, and just not being stupid. (trying not to point out any spoilers...) For example, the lady taking drugs to lose weight? was she out of her mind? not to mention her gradually stepping up the dosage. As with what happens to her son, i knew what they problem was the minute i saw it, and knew the consequences if he soon didnt get it fixed from that point early in the movie. The one good point I\\'d really like to point out is how they dont really distinguish between legal and illegal drugs, as with the lady popping pills that her doctor gave her, anything in moderation wont hurt you, and anything abused will, despite whether or not your doctor recommends it to you. I\\'ve known some people in my time who have become pretty messed up on perfectly legal drugs, and they dont even really exceed the dosage (to my knowledge). There\\'s not a miracle pill cure for everything, but our society seems to think there is, so pop the pill and everything will be better...Anyways, I\\'m off track, point is, the motives were clear, the message wasn\\'t, and the editing gave me a headache, i gave it a 3/10.',\n",

Snips of the floor are blown but I want more.The only thing funny in this movie is the casting: when I read Will.I.Am., Daniel Henny and \"And Ryan Reynolds\" in the beginning, I choke my chips. Reynolds is every teen guy\\'s idol, of course but the \"And\" preceding His VandWilderness does not meet the expectations for his appearance. Taylor Kitsch (who plays Gambit) is profoundly the next big character next to Schreiber as he suavely plays his deck. Schreiber is indeed someone who kills without the stare, to think that he lacks in here the wacko image, and the hippie long hair. ( READ MORE at )',\n",

I don\\'t like to use the word pretentious too often, it\\'s one of those overused FG words but I think it applies here. It really is nothing more than a bunch of misfits and underachievers who finally, at the end, realise they don\\'t care how the world perceives them. There, one simple sentence which encompasses this \\'full of itself\\' film perfectly.The whole \"funniest laugh out loud comedy of the year\" is also way off the mark and had me going into it expecting something different from what I got.I also didn\\'t like some of the ridiculous situations that happen in this, what I now realise was meant to be a mostly serious piece. One particular scene involving grandad in hospital was completely out of context and inexplicably ridiculous.All that said, I actually liked some of the characters, in particular the young boy and the grandad. The scene between them in the back of the Campervan raised a smile and the ending even raised a titter.So onto the ending.....I guess after the hour and a half of relative uneventfulness that went before, at least the main issue of the film, as explained in that simple sentence earlier, was brought to the fore in entertaining fashion and at least the film didn\\'t peter out which is what looked like was going to happen.',\n",

              " \"Kingsman: The Secret Service (2014): Dir: Matthew Vaughn / Cast: Colin Firth, Samuel L. Jackson, Taron Egerton, Sophie Cookson, Mark Strong: Matthew Vaughn's lighter followup to Kick-Ass. This one is less graphic yet similar in style and violence. It regards legacy and stars Colin Firth as agent Harry Hart who loses a fellow agent in the film's opening rescue attempt. Guilt ridden, Hart delivers a bravery medal to the agent's widow and infant son. This kid grows up and ends up being recruited as a possible agent through an encounter with Hart. He and several other youths are trained and it comes down to two recruits. Central plot regards an Internet millionaire who implants a SIM card in various individuals that results in outburst of violence. One scene, which occurs inside a hate group church is amongst the best footage Vaughn has ever shot, in its slow motion chaos and theme music. Vaughn's other worthy credits include X-Men: First Class and Stardust. Firth plays it straight as Hart whose appearance in the thick glasses, suit and umbrella denies his true abilities. Samuel L. Jackson dressed in an orange jump suit and cap on backwards steals scenes as this profane outrageous villain with a female sidekick whose legs are blades. Taron Egerton plays the young lead whose struggles merge with surprise when he must take centre stage when chaos threatens. Sophie Cookson as agent Roxy is fetching but underwritten. Mark Strong is featured from Kick-Ass but doesn't elevate beyond the standard role. Theme is identity and taking the secret agent clich√©s to a harrowing climax that does this inventive visual comedy tremendous service. Score: 8 ¬Ω / 10\",\n",

Memories, good or bad, can be perceived both as inspiration and learning ground, why do we want to eradicate someone in our life that easy? Isn\\'t that completely dumb? --- Wasting years of learning and appreciating what you had.

Spotless mind is really being clueless, its subjecting yourself to undergo suppression of the human mind by unconscious forgetting, its controlling the nature of the human.

No, Wall-E is nothing short of what movies should be. What can I say about this film? What makes it so great? To start it off, there is barely any dialog in here.

              " 'An above average \"Heist\" movie confidently directed by Ben Afleck who also takes the lead. Set in Boston, Affleck plays a career bank robber, Doug Macray, from the run down district of Charlestown, which is home to the criminal fraternity in general, and bank robbing aficionados in particular. The generous running time of 125 mins contains only three raids because, wisely, the story based on the Chuck Hogan novel \"Prince of Thieves\", concentrates on character rather than action and takes time to enjoy the location sets in Boston itself.Charlestown is a tight knit community to which Affleck\\'s gang return after a brilliant, visceral opening Bank raid. To English ears, the dialogue is sometimes mumbled and difficult to follow, but when a hostage is freed who it emerges also lives in Charlestown, the plot bites as MacRay starts to date the hostage and is easy to follow. Time worn themes of criminal codes of honour, redemption, justice and revenge are explored with a blue collar authenticity which just begs Bruce Springsteen to step out of the shadows at any time.Rebecca Hall as Claire skilfully unfolds the role of bank official turned unwitting girlfriend ,delivering a compelling, but understated performance even though her own back story is somewhat under written. Pete Postlethwaite is wonderful in a cameo as the local godfather in a ballsy performance, in every sense of the phrase.No such story would be complete without the Cop determined to bring the hoodlums to justice and John Hamm is convincing as FBI agent Hawley whose task in racking down the offenders is not that difficult. Why both he and McCray have to sport unshaven beard growth is never quite explained.A gripe is the Hollywood obsession with over the top shoot-outs. Although the opening bank raid, and subsequent security van raid are brilliant, the finale at the Boston Red Sox \\' Fenway Park becomes ridiculous and unconvincing, and is wholly unnecessary to a well plotted story. Fortunately an action free, but engrossing and satisfying denouement save the story from the ridicule it risks at Fenway Park.Strong, and atmospheric, with several nods to \"Heat\" this movie succeeds and delivers in spades suggesting that in the future Affleck will make a film that scores excellent, and not just the \"very good\" plaudits which this story has rightly been credited with..',\n",
              " \"Watched this movie for first time in whole. Saw parts of it before but not the full thing. My biggest problem with the movie was the story structure. The most interesting part was the famous bridge scene that starts with 40 minutes left. You could cut the rest of the movie out with only the last 40 or so and not miss anything. For the rest of the 90 minutes, the most interesting parts are lacking due to being in the height of the Hollywood blacklist and 1940s censorship hysteria. Even so, this movie is far from perfect with plot holes like the uncle losing $8000 to move the plot along for no other reason. George gives up his dreams his entire life and does things to please other people and is extremely depressed because of it. Even with the feel good ending, he will go back to being depressed. Because even though his financial problems are over, he's still putting everyone else above himself, he works at a job he hates, and was given a huge amount of money all at once when he was poor during his adult life due to his own choices. As fantastic as the ending is, it doesn't hold up to scrutiny because it doesn't feel earned from the other 90 minutes.\",\n",

I was hoping the movie would continue to the end without being clich√©, but this scene proved otherwise. Aside from this issue, the rest of the movie was great.

There is nothing else but some long boring episodes (I guess to extend the movie so as to create Kill Bill vol. 2) and some super violent scenes (blood fountains, countless chopped heads, arms and legs). It is advised to watch this movie with closed eyes.3. There is no Tarantino style left. No jokes, no philosophy, no anything, just blood and violence. R rating is what it deserves.

Well this is Hollywood and he is an expert safe- cracker. Along with his midget assistant who plays the elf, Billy Bob Thornton plays Santa Claus at various shopping malls every Christmas. However this is a prelude to rob the malls and spend the rest of the time getting drunk in Miami before next Christmas arrives.As Santa's go, he is mean, foul mouthed and nasty. He is bad Santa. As a comedy it does not really work unless you like seeing an adult being mean to kids although John Ritter and Bernie Mac do provide the laughs. Its more of a black comedy-drama of one man on the edge who finds some sort of humanity when he encounters a kid and see's some genuine kindness and forms some sort of bond and understanding.Without doubt the picture wrong-footed me as I expected a big lapse into sentimentality at the end of the film but Billy Bob Thornton's Santa has a heart smaller than the Grinch and although there is some light at the end and Bad Santa does thaw its not a mushy ending and there are other's in the film who are more nastier and cynical than Bad Santa.\",\n",

Bruce Willis is reasonable as the brooding David, basically re-enacting the role from the sixth sense, of a man with an uncertain past needing to participate in a voyage of self discovery before he can realize his destiny.It lulled me into a sense of expectation from trailers, posters and the Sixth Sense, which it then unfortunately betrayed by being a film that was shallow and unengaging.

My friend immediately suggested this movie, which I had never heard of. All of our other classmates immediately picked Anchorman:The Legend of Ron Burgundy. After watching this movie, Ron Burgundy needs to bow before Howard Beale, \"The Original Anchorman.\" Even though this movie was made 33 years ago, its relevance to today\\'s cutthroat broadcasting system is really eerie.Paddy Chayefsky\\'s Oscar-winning screenplay was seeing the future with the most disturbing clarity. The acting was superb by all of the cast(even though I did note the abnormal shouting matches throughout the movie, ha), it was riveting to see a network and its reporters go mad with ratings and lose their humanity in order to be the #1 show on television, even if it meant killing off one of their own.Howard Beale (Peter Finch) is an aging TV anchorman for UBS who is fired, effective in two weeks, after his ratings have been steadily deteriorating. He reacts to this by sensationally announcing on live television his intent to commit suicide on air. In doing so, Beale becomes a major TV icon and one of the most valuable assets to the Communications Corporation of America (CCA), the company that is gradually taking control of UBS. As a result he is given his own show as \\'the mad prophet of the air-waves\\'. He appears live on television every week-day evening to tell the real truth to the people of America. The program is a huge success but Beale uses his power to make startling revelations about CCA, leaving the company executives with a serious problem. Beale ultimately ends up going too far with his tirades upon discovering that the conglomerate that owns UBS will be bought out by an even larger Saudi Arabian conglomerate. Beale launches an on-screen tirade against the two corporations, encouraging the audience to telegram the White House with the message, \"I\\'m mad as hell and I\\'m not going to take this any more!\" in the hopes of stopping the merger. This throws the network into a state of panic due to the company\\'s various debts making the merger necessary in order for it to survive. The execs want Beale off the air in order to salvage what the network, but the chairman of UBS wants to keep him on. The execs realize that the only way that they can get of Beale is by assassinating him on the air.Wow, what a movie.

I feel that if you are going to spend ten or twenty minutes of your life in front of a computer in order to deliver a message about a movie to random strangers, the movie has either impressed you and you want to extol the sheer brilliance that you have just witnessed, or the movie was so bad that you want to JUST WARN PEOPLE TO STAY AWAY FROM IT! In the case of The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift, this is a HUGE WARNING. If you have a moment, take some time to read ahead and explore the crapfest that is The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift.Much, if not all, of this movie is crowded with higher tier actors (Vin Diesel at the end is the only exception... and to be honest... he\\'s not even that great of an actor.. he\\'s just good at his static, one dimensional character roles which require minimal talent). Lucas Black (you know..... that guy from Friday Night Lights...) hardly does any real acting. And of course, Bow Wow tops the list of amazing and talented actors that make up this movie (let\\'s not forget other classic Bow Wow movies such as Johnson\\'s Family Vacation...).Clearly, the script was written by a seventh grader. I see no possible way that a living and breathing human being can come up with so much horrible, gut-wrenching, cheesy, mindless dialogue. Some of the lines are also completely irrelevant to the \"storyline\" of the movie. They make the characters try to sound deep, but instead they created the biggest over indulgent piece of crap ever known to man. Ten minutes into the movie, and you\\'ll notice the problematic script. Yet the dialogue, sad to say, is not the least of its problems.The storyline. Man, wow............................................................ ............................................................... where do I begin?Sean Boswell is a seventeen year old student who loves to race cars. Challenging the rich kid, he completely destroys his car and is just a short step away from juvy. Instead, he gets sent to Tokyo to live with his father. So far, the plot makes sense. Here\\'s where it goes wrong. Sean Boswell gets drawn to the racing world.... Then an hour of complete crap happens, he learns to drift, and he challenges the nephew of the local mob boss to a race, making it clear to his father that \"he has to fix this\" ----> yea.... I\\'m just as lost as you are, the dialogue doesn\\'t help either. Then he wins the race (surprise surprise) and instantly becomes the new King of the racing world. Oh and guess what, he also wins the girl! no movie would be complete unless the guy wins the girl. Anyways, there really is no set plot here. A guy looking to stay out of trouble suddenly becomes the hottest thing in underground racing. Not to mention, the mob boss is a pansy. There really is no bad guy in this movie. You\\'d figure it would take more than a race for some seventeen year old kid to prove himself to THE MOB. Granted this goes down as a partial mob movie, it is probably the most inaccurate and stupid mob movie of all time.Basically this movie comes down to good looking cars, fast paced action, and Asian cleavage. What the film lacks in consistency, dialogue, acting, and everything else that makes a movie great, it tries to make up for in tight Asian skirts and huge breasts.What gives this movie any hope for a great review is the fast paced racing scenes. If there is anything Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift has done right, it\\'s the racing scenes. I must admit, they were pretty entertaining to watch.Yet that still does not make up for the poor acting, horrible script, and senseless/ridiculous plot that is The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift. Had the filmmakers polished up some of these areas, this film might have a fighting chance for a good review. However, right now that is not the case. The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift is a horrible abomination of everything that is right in this world.

Actually, it seems to be inviting you, by metaphorical ways, to think and analyze the process of ideological construction and interpretation of our day-to-day reality. At the beginning and at the end, Michael Caine\\'s character says \"you are not really looking, you want to be fooled\". Is he talking only about theather magic or algo talking about how we construct our vision of the world and our opinions about the most varied subjects? As a fellow user of this site said, there many layers in this movie to be analysed and discussed, and it is still a commercial movie, not some kind of experimental video done by college students. That, by itself, is an awesome achievement.The movie says that we want to be fooled, and that the magicians, in order to fool their audience, must be willing to deal with brutality and secrets. Aren\\'t the magicians, in this movie, a representation of our parents, leaders, bosses, and those who have power and need to ideologically and morally justify themselves, in order to stay in power? The upper classes need to present their rule as just and natural, but they know that power can not be achieved and retained only by virtous manners.

Oh, and she did a good job with the acting also.The story is pretty good.... and like I said... fun. There are parts that dragged on a little bit, especially at the beginning. I thought the movie would have been better had it been about 20 minutes shorter. There were parts when I was thinking... okay, I know what's going on, let's just move on to the next scene already. However, like I said... more towards the beginning. Once the story gets rolling it keeps you interested. There are some great action scenes, you just have to put aside your logic for the flying stuff... but... it's a comic book so....On the Gargamel scale it gets 1 for story 1 for acting 1 for car chase (but it's more of an air chase, and it's cool) 1.5 for guns/explosions and 0 for the nudity score... there is not full nudity but there is some implication that is pretty sexy.. wow, so that's a 4.5 which equates to a 9 on the IMDb scale. I'm surprised myself..\",\n",

While I agree with a previous reviewer that Rago's performance is weak, i don't think the ending is ruined by it. As a matter of fact, having been twice to watch it at the cinema i can attest that the ending had a profound impact on almost everyone both times.As to this same reviewer's comment that he finds the references to Racing club in the killers letters not credible, I think quite the opposite, he was very careful in not giving himself away, but the point is made that it was precisely his passion he could not bring under control, that finally got him busted.An last but not least, all the swearing in the language is not to be understood as childish scriptwriting.... most of us argentines truly speak like that in our everyday life.\",\n",
              " \"I get the impression that I was watching a different movie to the majority of other people I know who have seen this film. It's not really that I found the film offensive or anything - just that the script was unbelievably amateurish for a film that had obviously had a bit of money thrown at it. I really respected Paul Haggis' work on the Million Dollar Baby script and was bitterly disappointed to see how bad this script was. It was clear to me that it was desperate to be the 'racism' version of Traffic, but I don't think Traffic was really a film worth ripping off in the first place. The worst feature of thisfilm is the way it shamelessly spoon-feeds its audience. Does Haggisreally think we are so dumb as to require a shot of the blanks? Do wereally need to see the phone book sitting on Farhad's dashboard, withthe address circled in black texta? Can we not be left to make someleaps in logic for ourselves? I also had a major problem with the dialogue which was so 'on the nose'. I have heard one critic say that the quality of dialogue is deceptively high, because even though people may not speak this way, they certainly do think this way. That is irrelevant. It is the job of a script like this to utilise dialogue in a way that helps add to the characterisations and believability of the (in this case highly implausible) situations that are set up. These characters all speak using the same voice and all they ever talk about is racism. Surely the purpose of a film like this should be to promote the fact that race should not really be an issue in these situations, but by making it the sole focus of every scene, doesn't it become innately racist itself? Characters walk around spouting their philosophies and conveniently memorised statistics on race relations as though they're regurgitating extracts from the research essay they've just written. It's utterly unconvincing and obvious. A film should reveal its meaning gradually, not slap us in the face with it in the opening scenes and then never let up. I can see that Haggis' intentions with this film were honorable, but dare I suggest that by directing his own script he has not been able to identify and, therefore, overcome its flaws. I really hope that writer/directors will be really careful in future when approaching this 'mosaic' style of narrative. It has been done well a number of times, but getting the balance between the personal and the political right is very difficult. And Robert Altman will not be outdone in that department.\",\n",

In other words, I wasn\\'t interested in watching an extended \"cut scene\" made exclusively to the fans who knew every detail of this mythology by heart. And even though that\\'s not exactly what happened, the film Assassin\\'s Creed ended up unfortunately being a tedious experience. To start with, the screenplay is a disaster from the beginning to the end, simple on its surface (the main character\\'s conscience travels to the past), but unnecessarily entangled with weak corporate intrigues, unconvincing technology and an irregular style which breaks the flow of the story and clouds the motivations of the characters. What was won, what was lost and what is the next step? I don\\'t know, and I don\\'t care. Besides, the performances from Michael Fassbender, Marion Cotillard and Jeremy Irons feel absolutely bland and listless. And even though there are a few good action sequences, they are too brief and sporadic. But, well... I understand the disjunctive faced by co-screenwriters Michael Lesslie, Adam Cooper and Bill Collage: if the story is too simple, the fans will be angry; and if it\\'s too complicated, the casual spectators (like me) will end up confused and constantly snoozing (like me). In summary, a boring movie in which I unfortunately wasted my time.',\n",
              " \"Classic Charlie Chaplin movie. Complete with the usual incredibly creative visual comedy and romantic angle. Very funny. Contains some of Chaplin's most memorable and iconic scenes: the stewed boot, the dancing bread rolls (revived for a modern audience by Johnny Depp in Benny and Joon), the cabin on the edge of a cliff (which must have inspired scores of cartoon scenes).Incredibly innovative cinematography for 1925. The chicken illusion scene must have been very original and technologically advanced for its time.One disappointment, however. I saw the 1942 revised version of the movie, wherein Chaplin replaced the written dialogue with narration and added a more in-sync score. No issues with the score, but the narration spoils the movie, to an extent. The great thing about silent movies is figuring out the jokes and plot just by the visual medium. With the narration, it feels like you are spoon-fed the jokes and plot, and makes the whole movie feel dumbed-down.I haven't seen the 1925 version but I imagine I would enjoy that more.\",\n",

              " 'The Event Horizon is an abandoned ship found by the crew of the Lewis and Clark. Sam Neill plays the designer of the Event Horizon who lost contact with the crew and has gone to find his masterpiece. No spoilers here, but if you hate sci-fi or horror, give it a miss! Event Horizon is a cult film, not well received upon release but a sleeper of it\\'s day. Quite a large budget but never oversold, this sci-fi horror really delivers the goods due in large to the director, Paul W S Anderson. This genre is his forte and he is a director of distinction, using excellent visuals, keeping the tension prevalent making you feel on edge constantly. Great example of Sam Neill\\'s qualities with strong performances elsewhere, but it is the juxtaposition of the imposing girth of the \"techno-mediaeval\" Event Horizon and it\\'s gravity drive and the claustrophobic nature of the the Lewis and Clark which gives the feeling of despondancy, everything is stacked against the characters.The balance between British and American characters plus an Australian also makes this film better for me because you get a little tired of having an all American cast in big films, no matter how good they are. The acting in the film is good as a consequence in this, all of these good actors being up to their full standards. As for the story-line, well, it doesn\\'t get any better than a ship getting sucked down a black hole and coming back with an evil entity onboard which killed its crew and is bent on killing the rescue crew too. \"The Event Horizon\" is a stunning ship and the Gravity Drive is a stunning looking device to go in its heart - it\\'s no wonder that Dr. Weir became obsessed with it. But this film is a good example of how obsessions can become deadly, so watch out. The dark entity starts to make its presence known and eventually takes over Dr. Weir and kills most of the crew. It involves some fantastic scenes such as Justin depressurising in the air lock and some guy on a ship log recording pulling out his entrails though his mouth. Sounds gory? Yeah, it is, but don\\'t let that put you off even if you really need to have a strong stomach for it.Overall rating: 9 out of 10.',\n",

              " '\"We Need to Talk About Kevin\" is about a young boy who is exhibiting some pretty serious behavioural problems and then as a teenager is most likely responsible for some pretty heinous actions. It\\'s also about his mother. The recent excellent film \"Beautiful Boy\" (2010) follows similar relationships but takes the stance that it isn\\'t always the fault of the parents. This film seems to say to forget about that morality tale, it is the mother\\'s fault.This film would probably have been excellent if we really did talk about Kevin, as in have discussions, aka dialogue. Instead we spent an awful lot of time zooming in on his eyeball. And his mother\\'s eyeball. Every other scene also needed to have something or someone covered in red. Be it blood, paint, jam, spaghetti sauce or ketchup, this film was soaked in red. To me, the avant-garde style of filmmaking detracted from the story they were trying to tell.I\\'m also not sure I agree with what they were trying to say. But that can be a positive if they leave you with things to think about. Which they do \\x96 in spades.Kevin is a complex fellow and we never can be sure why he does the things he does. I have come up with some explanations for some of his actions but no definitive answer to \"Why?\" Part of that is because it\\'s a good way to structure a film, but it also leads to another problem.We start spending time with Kevin when he\\'s a toddler. Apparently he\\'s three but with the emotional and mental acuity of a twenty-something cynical adult. The young Rock Duer that played him was excellent but the writing for that character was far from believable. The teenage Kevin played by Ezra Miller was more appropriate and just as well portrayed. Behaving the way teenagers do but with this anger from years of mental derangement brooding beneath the surface. Ezra Miller has this tenderness to everything he does that instead of being scared of him we start feeling sorry for him.I, however, felt sorry for him from the beginning. I don\\'t think people like Tilda Swinton\\'s character should ever be allowed to be a mother. At least John C. Reilly grew into the role of a father. They were hippies that conceived their son while participating in some weird foreign spiritual ritual that involves being bathed in gallons and gallons of blood (I\\'m assuming animal blood and guts) along with hundreds of other people.

And here is why (contains minor spoilers): - The evil General Zod gains super powers once he arrives on Earth, yet he decides to take away a lot of these powers by terraforming Earth into Crypton? Yes, that makes a lot of sense! - Superman can breath in Space, yet he has problems breathing his own atmosphere and is weakened by that. - The Cryptonians have conquered star systems for 100,000 years, yet they decide to stop this because they run out of resources. And suddenly they lose all their spaceships to leave the dying planet. The movie explains it with these words: \"We are bound to our history and may not leave.\" Yeah right... never heard anything dumber. - The whole movie is one big action scene that seems like it has been stolen by other movies like Matrix III (the whole battle in and around the skyscrapers). The magnetic liquid metal looks like the robots in Matrix as well. Krypton in the start of the movie kind of looks like Star Wars with flying creatures from Avatar. And the scenes from the early Clark Kent seem to be inspired by X-Men a lot... So one could state that it is Man of Steal. To be honest: The entire second half of the movie is a stupid clash of stupid characters that take stupid actions that maybe look good. - And of course there is still no explanation as to why nobody recognizes Clark Kent as Superman. - Btw. the 3D is a joke!I mean, I did not expect this to be some sort of documentary, but some kind of believable story would have been nice.

              " \"As her 18th birthday approaches, Bella (Kristen Stewart) is finding it difficult to live a life where she would eventually become old while Edward (Robert Pattinson) retains his youth. When Bella's small birthday affair at the Cullen household threatens Bella's life, Edward decides that it is best if he leaves her fearing that he is causing her unnecessary danger. This results in Bella falling into a deep depression which her friend, Jacob (Taylor Lautner), hopes to relieve her from.Continuing the novel adaptation of the Twilight saga, New Moon is a misfit of sorts in the series thus far. Regardless of how accurately the novel is followed, the narrative appears to present little new or different from the story presented in Twilight. Bella is still a sad and pathetic person who needs the love of someone else to keep her going. Instead of Edward being her source of love, it is Jacob this time around. And like the first film, Bella's life is under threat from a handful of vampires, and these happen to contain the remainder of the original group from Twilight. In essence, New Moon is just Twilight wrapped up in new skin, arguably paler this time, and it will feel like this for a good chunk of the film until the introduction of the Volturi, the royalty of vampires. This small arc in the film definitely ramps up the narrative into more interesting territory outside the lifeless romance of before, and the characters this romance entailed. Though the story does have one thing going for it and that is humour, and the genuine kind to boot. The film is constantly comedic enough that you may even forget that it was meant to be a tragic romance of sorts akin to Romeo and Juliet, which the narrative blatantly tries to intertextualise with. Inevitably, the story has little substance and feels like a bridge between Twilight and the remaining sequels to come. This is because all the intriguing mythology added to the series in New Moon, such as the Volturi and werewolves, contribute nothing to the film but rather that they could be useful for the sequels.The acting is largely a better affair in the Twilight sequel but this mostly comes in the form of the lesser characters. Of the lot the more noticeable supporting performances come from the charm of Ashley Greene, the acute coldness of Dakota Fanning, and that rather mysterious elegance of Michael Sheen as the Volturi leader Aro. Of the three protagonists, it is only Lautner who makes any commendable effort at acting: he starts off rather low-key but gets himself into a decent position. It is disastrously unfortunate that neither Stewart nor Pattinson become anything more than simply dull. Both their respective characters are meant to be pained at the loss of being separated from one another but they always appear somewhat bored when in scenes together and show little conviction in their emotions. On the other hand, Stewart's scenes with Lautner have more going for them even when Stewart loses her gaze to Lautner's abs.Director Chris Wietz brings a commercial feel to New Moon which was lacking in Twilight, yet New Moon ultimately feels less unique than Catherine Hardwicke's efforts. This does not help the film in any way as it has less going for it than its predecessor did. Music is a love-hate affair: it feels way too forced in helping create a certain mood that at times the music feels oddly misplaced. The special effects are much improved and now look far from awkward. While the CG is never overly convincing, it is integrated well enough as to not be a distraction.For a film based on vampire romance, New Moon is pretty sexless in appeal beyond Lautner being shirtless. There is the odd use of mild language and while violence is more abundant than in Twilight, it is never harrowing enough considering the vampire and werewolf mythology.While somewhat enjoyable, New Moon lacks identity and this is solely based on the fact that it does little to enhance the Twilight formula. Richer mythology is added; the quality of acting has increased in the overall cast; and the special effects have undergone a needed retuning. But like Edward so blandly points about himself, the film lacks a soul. The brewing romance between Bella and Edward is lifeless with a general lack of development throughout all the characters. Likewise, the narrative never really seems to head in any viable direction and it is up to the lesser characters to get the film's blood pumping.\",\n",

It is a ridiculously sweet movie as we follow the life of real author JM Barrie, discovering how a close bond with a family inspired him to create Peter Pan. As we see his relationship with these people develop over the course of the movie we can really feel a real bond, it is written in a way that makes it so life like and believable, towards the end, getting quite heart wrenching. It was a little bit too heartwarming at times to a degree that it felt cheesy. Every scene, every piece of dialogue from the characters is very abrupt and honest, but this can feel somewhat forced when it's so frequent. People are not honest all the time, people do not speak the truth, its interesting when we have a character saying one thing, but learn from paying attention to the development of the character that he means something else, but in Neverland, everyone seems to say exactly what they are thinking.The cast is phenomenal, Dustin Hoffman shines in a small, but noticeable role, Kate Winslet is immensely effective as the struggling mother, and all the child actors are excellent young performers. Johnny Depp is, of course, the highlight as Barrie, playing a role a lot more toned down and normal in comparison to his usual Tim Burton-esque flamboyant characters, he is subtle, quiet and delivers a meaningful performance of a passionate writer and playwright, as well as an impressive Scottish accent.

I also liked Loki\\'s little \"redemption\" path, and there is a touching scene with him and Thor when Loki is supposedly \"dead.\" Surprisingly there was a lot of humor, some of which where the jokes landed, but most of the time it was very annoying. Natalie Portman is wonderful as Jane, Stellan Skarsgard is mostly used for gags, and Kat Dennings as Darcy is used for comic relief, very overused might I add. I disliked her character a lot in the first film, and that hasn\\'t changed since. The Captain America cameo though, that was so awesome. There\\'s much more action in this film than the first Thor film. As I previously stated, the action in the first film peaked when they fought the Frost Giants, but here there\\'s plenty. I loved every action set piece, especially the climax. Director Alan Taylor does a good job blending in fantasy and sci-fi all together, also adding a touch of Game of Thrones in there. As a matter of fact I think he did a better job than Kenneth Branagh in introducing the world of Asgard. My biggest complain in this film is the villain. I wanted more of Malekith in this film. Christopher Eccleston portrays an awesome Malekith, but however there really isn\\'t much character development over him. He\\'s just shown as an evil dude who wants to bring the world to darkness. Nothing more. Aside from a brief introduction told by Odin at the beginning about who he is and what his plan is, there isn\\'t any other character development for Malekith and he really suffers because of this. He doesn\\'t interact with enough characters only Thor and he never goes into any detail about why he\\'s doing what he\\'s doing without a clear motive or reason. Even though they had their own action moments, certain characters like Lady Sif and the Warriors Three that were promised larger roles instead were minor which was sort of a bummer. This film has some re-watch ability factor, where as the first Thor didn\\'t. Thor: The Dark World is just pure popcorn entertainment. 6/10',\n",

              " 'It is strange that the description above describes the crew of the U-Boat as \"raw recruits.\" Whoever wrote that must not have even seen the film. It is obvious that they were mostly veteran submariners.I was surprised to see in the credits that they had a technical adviser from the German Navy on this film, because the many errors (that could have been easily avoided with a little attention) detract a lot from the film. I mean things like the sound guy calling out a bearing to a target when his indicator dial is pointing in a quite different direction. Still, it is a gripping story that really makes you feel the desperation of a submarine crew struggling to keep their boat (never call one a \"ship\") and themselves alive after a severe attack.The biggest flaw is included in the film from the book. I guess the writer must have thought it would be sort of poignant to show something of how the \"brotherhood of the sea\" has to be abandoned in war when he had the boat surface at night to observe the burning tanker they torpedoed two hours before, and shoot another torpedo to \"finish her off,\" then having to back away leaving the surviving crewmen in the water to drown.One big weakness of the German U-Boats was their fairly small load of torpedoes. No competent U-Boat commander would have ever wasted a precious torpedo sinking a ship that was already doomed. But even worse was the act of surfacing at all. In a calm sea, with a brilliant tower of flames from the sinking tanker, the sub would have been easily spotted by any enemy vessel within many miles of there, while their own lookouts would have been blinded by the light of the fire. The whole scene was dramatic, but utterly absurd. In reality the sub would have had to get away from there as quickly as possible in order to surface and recharge its battery.Still, I have the DVD and enjoy watching it now and then. It is fun to play it with the English subtitles and notice how they sometimes differ from the German being spoken. Note also, for English speakers, that the title is correctly pronounced \"Das Boat.\"Some posts have called this the \"greatest anti-war film ever made.\" It certainly has a strong message about the futility and waste of war, but I think when it comes to the many fine anti-war films out there, one special film stands alone above all the rest. It is called \"Johnny Got His Gun.\" If you can find a copy of it, see it. Then you will have a proper basis for judging anti-war films.',\n",

              " 'Clearly, Netflix wants to go toe-to-toe with Hollywood, and they are challenging it with their own provocative, slam-bang, $90-million, pulp-fantasy-thriller \"Bright,\" toplining Will Smith and Joel Edgerton as a rare pair of LAPD beat cops. Although Smith plays a human, Edgerton is cast as an Orc! Essentially, \"Suicide Squad\" director David Ayer has taken his superb police procedural \"End of Watch\" (2012) and retooled it as something like director Graham Baker\\'s \"Alien Nation\" (1988) with the fantastic beings from Peter Jackson\\'s \"Lord of the Rings\" franchise. Clocking in close two hours, \"Bright\" conjures up non-stop action, nail-gnawing suspense, unbearable tension, complete with surprises and revelations galore. Smith is as charismatic as ever, but he isn\\'t mimicking his \"Bad Boys\" character Mike Lowery, a role that he plans to reprise in two forthcoming sequels: \"Bad Boys Forever\" and \"Bad Boys 4.\" As veteran patrolman Daryl Ward, he is mired up to his neck in devastating debt, and his chief aim in life is to survive long enough to get his pension. Meantime, Ward finds himself in a predicament like nothing any policeman has confronted. The world of \"Bright\" is as gritty, violent, and racially charged as 21st century America, but this imaginative epic takes place in an alternate universe where far-fetched creatures, such as Orcs, Fairies, Elves, and others have been co-existing with humans since the dawn of time. Were it not for these extraordinary characters, \"Bright\" would amount to little more than another foray in urban crime. Sadly, this inventive hokum suffers from two shortcomings. First, predictable plotting undermines the outcome because Ayer and \"Victor Frankenstein\" scenarist Max Landis paint themselves into a corner. Second, the filmmakers provide only the most basic backstory about this bizarre new world. Meantime, the original \"Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\" actress Noomi Rapace keeps things exciting as a demonic elf who tries to ice our heroes, while Edgar Ramirez is equally as tenacious as another kind of Elf with a badge. Patrolman Daryl Ward (Will Smith) isn\\'t ecstatic about having an Orc as his partner. In the alternate universe of \"Bright,\" Orcs are savage, toothsome creatures who resemble a a synthesis of olive-skinned albinos and ghoulish vampire of the 1922 silent horror classic \"Nosferatu.\" Basically, Orcs are blue-collar, bottom-feeders who stick together inseparably and rank beneath the most woebegone ethnic groups ravaged by poverty and racism. Nick Jakoby (Joel Edgerton of \"Smokin\\' Aces\") is a typical Orc, and his fellow Orcs display nothing but contempt for him. Since they have no use for him, Nick has no use for them. Indeed, Nick has always dreamed of wearing a badge. Imagine his surprise when his dream comes true, and the LAPD hires him on the grounds of diversity. Meantime, Daryl is desperately trying to hold onto his job. Unfortunately, riding with Nick is no bargain as Daryl discovers when out of nowhere a shotgun-wielding Orc blasts him with a shotgun. Fortunately, Daryl survives, but he isn\\'t happy that he must resume riding with Nick. Ward\\'s irate fellow police officers heap endless criticism on him for tolerating Nick. They argue that he should charge Nick for incompetency, so the LAPD will fire the rookie. Daryl\\'s fellow officers fear that if Nick proves himself as a valuable contribution to the force, more Orcs will follow.\\nWord has spread like wildfire around Los Angeles about a virulent league of Elves known as the Inferni. Moreover, these Elves have been toiling to resurrect a renowned \\'Dark Lord\\' warrior to subjugate mankind. Legend has it the Inferni can with a magical wand deemed \"a nuclear weapon that grants wishes.\" The Inferni are ranked as \\'bright\\' because they can wield this wand. Furthermore, accounts claim there may even be some humans who can brandish it. Meanwhile, anybody else who dares to touch it is doomed to incinerate themselves before they can realize their dreams. Daryl and Nick stumble onto a wand one evening in a hood when they respond to a shooting and find themselves in the middle of a supernatural showdown. They help a renegade young Elf, Tikka (Lucy Fry of \"Mr. Church\"), who has slain another Inferni with that deadly incandescent wand. Dumbfounded by these circumstances, Daryl summons his watch commander, Sergeant Ching (Margaret Cho of \"One Missed Call\"), and his fellow patrolmen, to make sense out of this uncanny situation. No sooner have they arrived than the police see the wand as an answer to all their troubles. Furthermore, they conspire to kill Daryl and Nick, so nobody will know how they acquired the wand. Daryl turns the tables on them, then Nick and he realize they are now being stalked by a more formidable Inferni, Leilah (Noomi Rapace), who wants the wand and is prepared to kill anybody who gets in her way. Indeed, Leilah is ten times more powerful than Tikka, and Leilah\\'s posse is pretty much indestructible, too. If Daryl and Nick don\\'t have their hands full enough, they must contend with a crippled gangsta, Poison (Enrique Murciano of \"Collateral Beauty\"), who needs the wand, so he can walk again. Poison rules an army of trigger-happy, machine-gun toting thugs. Adding to the complications is another Elf, Kandomere (Edgar Ramirez of \"Point Break\"), a government agent who supervises a Federal Magic Task Force that wants the mysterious wand, too.\\nDirector David Ayer rarely lets our embattled buddy cops catch their collective breath as they run a gauntlet consisting of the ruthless Inferni, Poison\\'s homicidal hellions, and corrupt LAPD officers. Before everything works out for them, Daryl and Nick must dodge barrages of bullets and discover that the wand can resurrect the dead. Ayer intersperses the careening car chases, harrowing shootouts, and high-octane explosions with plenty of exposition, so we learn little by little the amazing powers of the wand and the various characteristics of the heroes and villains. \"Bright\" delivers more than enough wattage to keep audiences enthralled before its obligatory feelgood ending',\n",

This movie is of great quality, maybe not as much Character depth as Reservoir Dogs, but it has a hell of enough.

Confidential used major surgery to transform brilliant but impossibly stream-of-consciousness writing into a singular, excellent, same-but-different movie. It\\'s not impossible and it\\'s not anathema to make major changes.The Hobbit makes a lot of changes from the text, but very few improvements. A scene is added at the beginning to show some history in an effective, concise way, and I understand the addition of major players at Rivendell to provide a little more exposition even if I found it boringly rendered. (If Galadriel spoke any more slowly, she would be impossible to understand. Every word sounds as if she\\'s emerging from a coma and doesn\\'t know what she\\'s saying.) Really poor changes include the addition of two silly drug references; obnoxiously sugary, cutesy-poo scenes with Radagast the Brown; at least four endless, pointless CGI sequences designed to tie into theme park rides; and an excessive emphasis on childish humor, of the boogers-and-belching variety.Continued lameness from the movie trilogy includes sword killing that doesn\\'t cause bloodshed, smarmy hugging by characters known for being hard-cased curmudgeons, and the omission of what might be considered negative personality traits in people who used to be complex characters but now must be unconditionally adorable in order not to confuse the simpleminded.This used to be a tale of adventure, showing a spoiled, untried person having his metal refined through hardship and finding inner strength. There was darkness in this story, and truly harrowing moments, and depth for all the lightness. Now it\\'s just a wacky romp designed for maximum marketing.They could have made a really good movie and STILL made a lot of money, but they chose to make an overlong, horribly cartoonish, Keystone Kops ordeal.If you see this movie, and it is eminently skippable, pause during the fight of the stone giants to get a glimpse of the \"real movie\" direction they could have taken while keeping the fantasy intact.

              " \"I saw this movie on Quentin Tarantino's recommendation alone - apparently the previews of it scared my entire friend network and family away. Everyone said 'too gross!' 'too scary!' which I think are perfectly great reasons to see a horror flick. Having read many interviews with Tarantino, one of which in Fangoria, I figured he has similar tastes with me and so I figure if he's presenting, I'm paying to see it on the big screen.Hostel starts out with three friends (two American, one Icelandic) staying at a hostel in Amsterdam. Sex, drugs, and jokes ensue. Actually, the portrayal of the American post-undergrads is one of the better representations I've seen. Usually the kids are really dumb and all cookie-cutter the same, so it was refreshing to see some 'kids' that I probably would have known in college.I should warn the set-up to the gore and horror is slow-coming because I think Roth really wants you to like his characters. I didn't find the beginning set up to drag at all but I know many horror fans will because they want to see the violence right off the bat.When the gore and horror do begin, they don't disappoint. Following a promise for some of the sexiest and easiest women in the world, the trio travel to a Slovakia hostel where they have a pretty good time before one of them disappears. What is this place and why are they killing kids!? I already knew because I'd seen Tarantino and Roth interviewed on late night. If you know the basic premise it will be pretty easy to figure out what's going on.The gore is EXCELLENT and EXPERTLY done. I'd like to consider myself a connoisseur of horror make-up and this was perfect for me. Not too over-the-top, not to stingy. If you were disappointed in not seeing anything sawed off in 'Saw' then watch this! Also to note there are many Tarantinio directorial touches in the film...it's like he said 'Eli wouldn't it be great if you did this with that shot....etc.' So well directed is what I'm saying - great camera work was done.The movies' ending took a bit of an unexpected turn for me but that is because I was expecting something really wacky for an ending (Roth did do 'Cabin Fever'...) but there is no wackiness there..actually it's pretty damn serious.The acting was pretty good for a group of unknowns (and thank god they didn't use another B-list TV star, getting SICK of that!).If you're going to see a horror movie on the big screen, this is the one to see.

              " 'A farmer falls in love with a woman from the big city. She encourages him to murder his wife, after which he can sell the farm and live in the city with her. She figures out how he can do it, by faking a boating accident in which the wife drowns. He takes his wife out into the middle of the lake, starts to kill her, but finds he cannot do it. However, his wife saw the murderous intent in his eyes and flees from him as soon as they reach the other side of the lake. He keeps catching up with her, and she keeps trying to get away. Little by little, they reconcile, and she forgives him.Now, we all know that in a lot of old movies, a woman is expected to forgive her husband\\'s indiscretions, and if she does not, she is regarded as foolish and wrongheaded, such as in \"The Women\" (1939) or \"The Philadelphia Story\" (1940). But it is one thing for a wife to forgive adultery, and it is quite another thing for her to forgive his almost carrying out a plan to murder her. And yet this movie would not only have us believe that a wife could forgive such a husband, which is preposterous, but it also would have us regard her forgiving him as an expression of the purity of her heart, which is outrageous. No woman should forgive that, and any who did is a fool.The man and his wife essentially renew their vows by watching another couple\\'s wedding, and then carry on like a couple of newlyweds on their honeymoon. Finally, it is time to go home, and they get back on their little boat and head across the lake. A storm suddenly appears, capsizes the boat, and he believes that she has drowned. So, in a manner reminiscent of \"An American Tragedy,\" the accident that he was planning to fake actually happens.When the woman from the big city comes looking for him, thinking that he pulled it off, he becomes furious and starts strangling her. The idea is that she is the villain of the piece. In other words, it was really her fault that he almost murdered his wife. So while his wife forgave him, he does not forgive this woman. And just as the movie would have us approve of the wife\\'s forgiving the husband, it would also approve of the woman\\'s being strangled, giving her what she deserved.At the last minute, it turns out his wife has been rescued. He stops strangling the woman and returns home to be with his wife and child. The sun rises, presumably symbolic of the couple\\'s fresh start in having a happy marriage.The patriarchal attitude of this movie, that a woman should forgive her husband of his sins because it is some other woman who is really to blame, is all the more stunning in that the men who produced this movie and held these views apparently did so without the slightest sense of just how self-serving those views really are.',\n",

Another shoddy collection of other films into a new sci-fi I thought. Wrong.This story doesn't have a hero, it has many flawed characters, all of whom behave unexpectedly and change before you as the story unfolds. The suspense of the story is pulled from the lack of trust between these characters and the whole premise of complete darkness throughout. The idea of having the one person who could save everyone as being the one person there's no way on any planet you could trust, is ideal. It also brings forth the idea that you're behind the bad guy all the way, just like the Terminator.My surprise at the effects, the acting, the standard of filming and storyline was high.

              " \"(RATING: ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ¬Ω out of 5) THIS FILM IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. IN BRIEF: Superb acting and an honest insightful screenplay make this family drama all the more memorable. GRADE: B+ SYNOPSIS: A family tragedy impacts a solitary man who must now suddenly rearrange his life and priorities. JIM'S REVIEW: Everyone and everything has been estranged from Lee Chandler. Divorced, content to do menial work, devoid of close family ties and dear friends, Lee is a solitary figure ill-prepared for life. A sudden family tragedy leads him back to his nephew, Patrick, a confused and angry teenager. Forced into the father role, a role he personally disdains, Lee must come to terms with his family obligations in Kenneth Lonergan's powerful drama, Manchester by the Sea. Written and directed by Mr. Lonergan, the film is an insightful character study, not only of one man and the challenges he faces on a daily basis, but of the entire Massachusetts community that he calls home. We meet his fragmented family, including his brother (in flashbacks), his ex- wife, and other colorful townies. Not much is said directly, yet much is inferred as they all allude to Lee's deep dark secret at various times and we slowly begin to piece together Lee's broken life and intangible dreams. The ensemble cast is wonderful. Casey Affleck is mesmerizing as the desolate Lee. His is an introspective restrained performance. He shows a man filled with hopelessness and pain, quiet in his words, even if his actions seem violent and uncontrolled at times. Watching the actor react with subtle glances away from loved ones or downcast stares to hide his sorrow is so heartfelt and real. Abandoned by his dysfunctional parents, Lucas Hedges also brings a nuanced and sincere portrayal of a teenager left to fend for himself. Giving more than ample support are Kyle Chandler, Gretchen Mol, and particularly Michelle Williams as Lee's ex-wife. While her part does not share enough screen time, her scene confronting Lee is raw and moving and sure to earn her some award recognition. The film has nary a false note, its dialog capturing the real life feel of a middle class town and its vivid characters struggling over hard times. The film is all drama without a shred of melodrama or artificial theatrics. There are some minor directorial missteps however:. Some intrusive classical music never quite gels with its surroundings and that mournfulness is far too manipulative and overt, Also, in a small role, Matthew Broderick suddenly appears. His recognizable screen persona seems too jarringly out-of-place with the gritty realism of the film. That said, Manchester by the Sea is a bittersweet story (with an emphasis on the first syllable). It is bleak, sad, and melancholy, perhaps the feel-bad movie of the year. Yet it shows irony, humor, and love so candidly. Mr. Lonergan's film depicts our flaws, our awkward moments, our inability to communicate and simply express our emotions. But, more importantly, his film shows truths that are generally ignored in today's cinema. Manchester by the Sea is one of the best film to convey the meaning of family and all of its complexities in a totally honest and refreshing way. It is one of the year's best.\",\n",

Each individual quest is infatuating and we become concerned for lake town, for legolas, for gandalf and for the company of dwarfs. Smaug by the way is brilliant, much has been said about the idea of a talking dragon, especially since the comparison to the LOTR where no creatures spoke, apart from the human like, his character gives a real menacing personality to what is a seemingly unbeatable foe. The villains are truly great altogether Smaug, the necromancer, bolg and azog all create an essence of darkness and inevitable defeat for the good people of middle earth.

              " 'Now, there are some really sad movies out there that you\\'ve seen, but in my lifetime of watching movies I think this one made me cry the hardest, and left the greatest impact on my life. Its been several months now and I still can\\'t get over this movie and the image of the young girl Leslie Burke(AnnaSophia Robb)who changed a the life of a boy Jesse Aarons(Josh Hutcherson)who was struggling with his life of endless, bullying, parental neglecting, unobtainable love and sibling conflict. When I walked into the movie theater I expected another Narinia type movie, full of magic and wonder like you get from Harry Potter movies but I found myself not disappointed, the movie turned out better than expected. I have to admit the trailers were really deceiving, and that\\'s a thumbs down from me, but the trailer has nothing to do with the movie. I\\'ve heard a lot of negative comments about this movie and that\\'s understandable I\\'m opened minded to what others think, it was a really sentimentally surrounded movie. If you\\'re more of an action type person than this movie isn\\'t probably for you. The themes of the are primarily friendship, imagination and dealing with loss. Its an excellent movie for families, I strongly recommend it for that. Personally, I believe this movie is better than a traditional fantasy, instead it incorporated the concept of imagination as well as adding a more meaningful end. The movie is based on a novel written by Katherine Patterson, its one of the BEST and absolute best book to movie adaptations I\\'ve ever seen if not the best. It brings the general plot line as well as keeping important details into a modern day perspective from the 1970s. The modern day setting doesn\\'t bother me if anything it makes it more relatable. The actors were absolutely terrific, Josh Hutcherson successfully portrays the depressed and lonely Jesse Aarons while AnnaSophia Robb captures Leslie\\'s enthusiasm for life, friends and imagination. Their contrasting personalities fit well together making their friendship a more meaningful. The special effects were amazing being done by the same special effects teams of the Lord of the Rings movies. I think the special effects were really important in terms of portraying the imaginations of Leslie and Jesse to the audience it would have been redundant to watch them just play fight monsters by whacking a tree with a stick. The book was more like that, so if anything the movie is better than the book in terms of communicating imagination to the audience. I really must emphasize that AnnaSophia Robb is absolutely beautiful she really is, she gives off this innocent but fun image and I think that is important in order to make the death of Leslie Burke more tragic because the audience can more deeply admire the character. In the original book and another adaptation that was made in the 80s. Leslie Burke is portrayed as a girl looking more like a boy which turns people off in terms of her character, even though the imagine of the character is not traditionally used, her blonde hair, quirky, fun personality gives and brings Leslie more to life. I\\'m not a big movie critic, I don\\'t like to give movies really bad ratings and such because every movie is different I respect that, I just go with what I feel and if the movie is simply good or not and what impact did it have on myself.

              " \"The original Mummy film is the best in the series. And I liked every film in the series. For years people said that these films were rip offs of Indiana Jones. Well, in adventure level, yes, a lot like Indiana Jones. But no rip off. The Mummy films aren't as good, but they are fun.Brendan Fraser stars as Rick O'Connell, an American serving in the French Foreign legion. While in an ancient city, Rick accidentally awakes a mummy named Imotep(played by Arnold Vosloo. He also meets a librarian(played by Rachael Weiz) and her brother(played by John Hannah.The original film is the most original. It's also the least stupid and most fun. The sequel, The Mummy returns copied off of this one quite a bit. The 3rd one, Tomb of the Dragon emperor, wasn't a rip off but was dumb fun.I have enjoyed the whole trilogy. The original is the best. Second would probably be the second one now that I think about it. Then the third one would come in last place. A lot of people hate these movies. I don't see it. It is certainly not art, but it is a lot of fun and like the others, it is never boring.The Mummy: B+\",\n",
              " '\"The Town\" isn\\'t the very best heist movie that I have ever seen but it is one of them and is also a very interesting movie to watch, and it has a plot line that can be pretty hard to follow at times but despite that it still works as a whole movie. This is the second movie directed by Ben Affleck before he directed \"Argo\" (2012) which is the best of the two movies that I saw that were directed by him. Not only does Affleck direct but he also stars as a man named Doug MacRay a native of Boston, Massachusetts who is a criminal who specializes in robbing banks and other places. MacRay\\'s best friend since childhood and trusted cohort is James Coughlin (Jeremy Renner) of which they get along very well and treat each other like the brothers they never were. As the film opens we see a bank robbery in progress in a Charlestown bank where the robbers dress up in creepy costumes and they force the bank manager who is a young woman named Claire Keesey (Rebecca Hall) who is then abducted and then released. After the first robbery MacRay starts to fall in love with Keesey after seeing James\\'s sister Krista (Blake Lively) who also happens to be a drug addict. After the first robbery the case is sent to the local FBI and the investigation is headed by Special Agent Adam Frawley (Jon Hamm) and then a whole lot of other robberies happen probably in order to screw up the investigation which is my personal interpretation. The man in charge of the robberies is a flower shop owner named Fergus Colm (Pete Postlethwaite)who may have Irish mob connections. The backstory to this movie the relationship between Doug and Claire which is really nice to watch despite knowing the fact that violence will eventually happen. The most effective scene in the movie is where Doug talks to his father Stephen (Chris Cooper) in prison and is wondering about his mom and then that gets his dad really mad. I congratulate Affleck for making this movie and succeeding because in my opinion he has entered an elite class of directors who know how to make a really good heist movie (the other two being Spike Lee and Sidney Lumet), there are many good things about the movie which is the story which was adapted from Chuck Hogan\\'s novel \"Prince of Thieves\" which I didn\\'t read before seeing this movie, the performances are very good throughout, and the heist scenes and the love story keep this movie on the high ground. The one major problem that I had with this movie and prevented this movie from getting a 10th star was the feeling I had that Affleck and his writers rushed into things while making this movie without explanation of what was going on throughout the movie, otherwise there was nothing else wrong with the movie. Ben Affleck is a very skilled director, writer , and a good actor, and I hope that someday he does another really good heist movie but one that is even better than this one.',\n",
              " \"The Marvel Universe is without any doubt one of those Hollywood hypes I just can't get my head around. What is it that makes people fall in love with those superheroes who are no more than embodiments of the American value-system? And, even more so, why are the bad guys always in business with (semi-)communists, (Arabian) terrorists or evil (Russian or Asian) scientists? The clich√©s are too much for me. Maybe it's because I'm European. But that doesn't explain why so many Europeans dig this franchise. So maybe it has nothing to do with all that and it's just plain old Hollywood: looking for the greatest common divisor to capitalize on, in other words the best commercial formula for the highest profit. When realizing this it isn't all too bad to watch those Marvel films, 'cause it's only Hollywood numbness and as a viewer you just need to lower yourself to that level. It then also becomes possible to measure those movies against each other. When doing so the pattern - for me - gets quite clear: the second phase of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (Iron Man 3, Thor: The Dark World, Captain America: The Winter Soldier and Guardians of the Galaxy) is way better than the first one (which only had The Avengers that distinguished itself). I'm not anticipating any of the future Marvel films (at least 11 are in the running), but when seeking brainless entertainment, I suppose there's a lot worse out there.\",\n",

Burton is doing the same schleck over and over, but it's not getting better with practice. Despite its apparent popularity, the Corpse Bride isn't clever or innovative or particularly original. On the other hand, it was inane, predictable, and boring. There aren't two good jokes in the whole mess. Burton seems to think that having an eye pop out is so funny that he does it a half-dozen times without ever provoking even a snicker. The musical score is an absolute disaster. For the millions of dollars wasted in production, you'd think someone could have come up with a witty ditty or two. The characters are a waste of clay unless you think a parade of goofy caricatures is entertaining. The animation isn't even impressive by today's standards. What's to like about the Corpse Bride? You'll live through it. Or at least I did. About half-way through, I started wanting to die, but I didn't. I guess that something positive.I give it 3 out of 10 stars.

              " \"Sports movies are often predictable and enjoyable, but they are not always as fun as Bend It Like Beckham. I'm certainly no soccer fan, but Parminder Nagra completely won me over as the young girl Jess, who is trying to simultaneously pursue her dream of playing soccer and appease her traditional Indian parents. She is befriended by the gawky Keira Knightley, who recognizes the potential Jess has. Nagra accurately portrays the typical naivet√© of someone with controlling parents, unsure of her own abilities. Nagra is believable and sensitive in her starring role. Knightley is used in support here, but she is equally as good. Both girls' mothers are caught up with traditional ideas of what their daughters should or shouldn't do, and this provides the comic fodder for the audience to feed upon. Here the fathers are the rational parents instead of boobs, which is otherwise too often the case in these kind of movies. Juliet Stevenson is hilarious as Knightley's well-meaning but idiotic mother who jumps to one conclusion too many. Jonathan Rhys-Meyers plays the girls' soccer coach with his own parental demons. The film is co-written and directed by Gurinder Chadha, and it's a lot of fun. *** of 4 stars.\",\n",
              " \"Title: The MummyCondensed Storyline: A group of explorers discover the lost city of Hamunaptra, they soon awaken the mummy who hunts them down one by one to assimilate their organs and bodily fluids. Notable Acting: Brendan Fraser is known for his role as Rick, and his role in the franchise is what some believe to have made the movie work in the first place. Needless to say, the other movies he's been in haven't been as good as his role here. Rachel Weisz plays the Evelyn who always needs rescuing as she is the damsel in distress. John Hannah plays everyones favourite coward Jonathan, he acts like a coward and ultimately is one in this movie and we love him for it. Kevin J. O'Connor plays a similar role to John Hannah in this movie but Kevin's character of Benny will side with who ever will give him money. Noticeable Camera work: The movie is great at faming up its shots, especially for scenes of torture of death, making it so you can't see it, but still grasp the feeling of what is going on. Time lapse of a couple thousand years while we are looking a the statue of Anubis. Dolly shots following the action in the first fight scene Worms eye view of the MedjaiGraphics: The CGI in this movie is great for its time, be it the CGI for the mummy or the scarabs, it is great. The mummy looks like it is there, the effects that have been used with the sand are convincing and make to be an amazing movie. Incorrect Science: The 'Book of the Dead' should be the 'Scroll of the Dead', because Ancient Egyptians didn't use books, they used scrolls only. The Roman Empire invented the book layout which is used today. Evelyn says that the scarabs ate Imhotep alive and very slowly, but every time we see them on screen, they always eat people within seconds. There were 5 canopic jars in the chest, but only 4 are used in actual mummification. Evelyn also mentions that they would take out all of the organs, this is incorrect as only the lungs, kidneys, intestines and stomach were put in canopic jars and the brain was removed and discarded. The heart and other organs were kept in. Imhotep fears cats because they are the guardians of the underworld, in actual Egyptian mythology, cats were worshiped as gods because they were connected to the goddess Bastet who was the goddess of motherhood and protection. The actual guardian of the underworld was Anubis who would guide the souls of the dead into the afterlife or the underworld. Overall Feel: When I was younger, I had an ingrained fascination with Egyptology and this film was one of my all time favourites. So much so I watched this movie (Which is rated 15 for DVD) and I watched it over and over being only single digits in age at the time. So I will try and be not so bias in my review. This movie has its fair share of faults, especially when it comes to knowing about Ancient Egypt, but I would blame this more on the screen writers than anyone else. This is movie was made a year after Deep Rising, using a similar horror theme along with the actor Kevin J. O'Connor. Before this franchise, there were only mummy movies for the 'golden era' of cinema, which had the notoriously bad and some what cheesy effects that you would expect which classic monster movies, this movie made mummies cool again. This movie does have jump scares, but they are mild and are just there for the characters in the movie more than the audience.\",\n",

              " \"*** This review contains HUGE SPOILERS for the movie AND THE BOOK ***Although I don't usually write reviews with spoilers, this total botch of a film requires me to discuss several essential plot points in order to explain just how poorly the movie has been made.Films need not slavishly follow the books on which they are based. Movies often need to remove minor subplots and to rearrange certain details for dramatic effect. With that said, however, Alfonso Cuaron's dreadful screenplay manages to take a pretty good book by P. D. James and turn it into a preachy, incoherent mess driven largely by fight scenes, chase scenes, and heavy-handed political statements.Let's start with the climax of the film: for the first time in over eighteen years, a child is born. Excuse me, but aside from the novelty value, why should anyone in that sad world care? No one knows what's causing the sterility, so there's no reason to believe that the birth is anything but a fluke. Even if the child herself turns out to be fertile, there are now two fertile women in the entire world. Big deal.This illogical point is nowhere to be found in the book. The novel makes it clear that only men have become sterile, so finding even one fertile man would indeed be a basis for hope that the world might regenerate. The father of the child is clearly fertile, and the battle for his sperm is charged with both dramatic and political interest. The child also turns out to be a boy, providing additional hope. Unfortunately, Cuaron ditched this logical and interesting story in favor of a soft-headed Christian/feminist allegory that doesn't work at all. Worse yet, he allows the movie to plod onwards through a mind-numbing half hour of tedious fight scenes after the climactic birth.The book raises some thought-provoking issues about how such a society might function. Much of the book's thoughtful balance is achieved through the back-and-forth between Theo and his friend Xan. Xan? Who the hell is that? Xan is the nominal leader of England and one of the book's central characters. Replacing him with some minor bureaucrat who has about two minutes of screen time was a fatal error. The moral ambiguities of Xan's edicts -- should even minor criminals be carted off to some hell-hole prison to preserve order in a crisis? -- have been replaced by ham-handed and endlessly repeated scenes of illegal immigrants being mistreated and deported.Cuaron could have taken this interesting story, tightened it up a bit (the book is too drawn-out), and ended up with a fine film of psychological and moral complexity. Unfortunately, he took the opposite route, grossly oversimplifying the ethical issues and focusing on the tiresome chases and fights that represent the book's weakest moments. A major disappointment.\",\n",

              " 'Love stories are essentially the same -- it\\'s a matter of how you dress them up. Many will see through \"Love and Other Drugs\" and count the romance clich√©s and formulaic characters, others will find the 1996 setting and the pharmaceutical angle refreshing. Both forces are hard at work in this film, but the tipping point goes in favor thanks to the leads, Jake Gyllenhaal and Anne Hathaway. There\\'s a reason most romantic films are judged based on the chemistry of their lead actors. When it comes to romance, it\\'s not about how cleverly written the two characters are and how unique and special they feel to us. What counts is whether they can convince you of their attraction/love and get you to -- without blunt coercion -- invest in what happens to them. Gyllenhaal and Hathaway have what it takes to do just that in spite of a script that sometimes tries to lean too hard on conventional tactics of boys meets girl. Gyllenhaal plays Jamie, an expert salesman who lands a gig as a pharmaceutical sales rep for Pfizer, right before Viagra hit the market. He\\'s also adept at landing any woman he desires. He epitomizes a Don Juan and he\\'s plays the type well, but when you can predict that he\\'ll end up in bed with the next attractive woman that shows up on screen, the writing has taken it a bit far. As good of a filmmaker as Edward Zwick is, his best credits include \"Glory,\" \"The Last Samurai\" and \"The Blood Diamond\" -- not exactly romance. He co-wrote the script (based on Jamie Reidy\\'s memoir) with longtime collaborator Marshall Herskovitz and thriller writer Charles Randolph (\"The Interpreter\"), so no real romantic comedy prowess exists among them, hence the tendency to stick with genre conventions. One such convention is Jamie\\'s brother (Josh Gad), who plays the little brother crashing on Jamie\\'s couch who has a porn addiction and makes clueless statements, usually to the tune of no laughs, but he does help break the tension. Enter girl. Jamie meets Maggie, a bit of a free-spirited cynic who (in a unique twist) has way early onset Parkinson\\'s. Many will be quick to jump on the \"diseased girl\" archetype, but don\\'t judge Hathaway\\'s prowess that quickly. As completely pathetic as Maggie\\'s self-esteem might be and how strictly anti-commitment she is, when her character caves in to the romance as they all do, Hathaway gives Maggie a believable fragility rather than a melodramatic tone. Jamie\\'s motives for wanting to spend more time with Maggie and not simply continuing his streak of banging all who possess lady parts are reduced to the reason of \"she\\'s playing hard to get,\" which is not the best of reasons. The same can be said about Maggie constantly accusing Jamie of having pity sex with the diseased girl. However, watching these two charm each other and overcome the clich√© has a definite appeal. The two spend a lot of naked time together, making \"Love and Other Drugs\" the best date movie this holiday season. But on a serious note, the drug angle and the \"recent past\" setting give us something else to chew on, which is nice. Zwick never truly marries that story line with the romance except \"Jamie sells drugs and Maggie has a disease that lacks an effective one.\" The thematic ties are not quite there despite the plot coincidences and the fitting title. \"Love and Other Drugs\" is hardly the cure for the common romantic comedy, but the consistent dosage of its two stars by and large pushes away those symptoms. ~Steven C',\n",
              " '\"Hot Fuzz\" is a co-production between France, the United Kingdom and the United States of America that resulted in this 120-minute movie in the English language. It was released back in 2007, so it has its 10th anniversary this year. The director is Edgar Wright and I am sure you have already seen something by him. He wrote the script together with lead actor Simon Pegg who plays Nicholas Angel. So yes despite the several production countries, this is certainly a very British movie. You may have come across Wright and Pegg already in \"Shaun of the Dead\" or, more recently, \"The World\\'s End\". But we shall talk about these on another occasion. Now it is all about this 2-hour film we have here. The cast includes several pretty familiar faces like Oscar winner Jim Broadbent or Bond actor Timothy Dalton (looking a bit like Daniel Day-Lewis) as well as Golden Globe winner Bill Nighy. Dalton actually makes for a pretty good villain I must say, a nice positive surprise in here. Pegg is solid and gives the film some dramatic tension while everybody around it feels like turning it into a 100% comedy, so it elevates the level quite a bit and despite initial uncertainty I approve of Pegg here. Nonetheless, it is all about the comedy really. The crime and mystery aspects are there, but they never really work as well as the humor. This is not a problem at all as they never wanted to make these work as well I am sure.My favorite scene is probably when Broadbent\\'s character keeps talking about how police officers who make mistakes like speeding or driving under the influence have to make up for it by handing free ice cream to the entire force and that\\'s pretty hilarious. Much funnier than it sounds here I\\'m sure. Anyway, Freeman (Martin, not Morgan) who I am usually not too big on and Coogan had a solid little cameo early in the film and it was also one of the better scenes. As a whole, I would say that I very much recommend the first 80 minutes or so until we see all the townsfolk at that ceremony which looks like a dark mess or something. Sadly, this is when the film loses a lot of quality afterward. It loses itself in pointless fights, special effects and action sequences while sacrificing the nice tension and approach from the entire almost 1.5 hours before that. I have no idea why they decided to make such a huge break there in terms of tone and atmosphere, but I absolutely do not approve. And this was really a negative deal breaker for the film. It would so much have deserved a better ending / final chapter. Luckily everything before that was still good and convincing and entertaining enough that I can give it a thumbs-up, even if it is not as enthusiastically of a thumbs-up as I had hoped. Watch it though, especially if you like some of the other Wright/Pegg collaborations from before/after 2007. I also have a feeling that we will get a sequel at some point I guess, but we\\'ll see. British movies tend to take their time with follow-up films if we take a look at T2 this year for example. But \"Hot Fuzz\" is just too popular a film I guess that they never return to the story. Enough now. See it.',\n",

              " 'The moment David Lean makes you aware you are in the hands of a master comes early on in \"Lawrence of Arabia.\" Lawrence (Peter O\\'Toole) holds a lit match close to his lips and with one quick puff of air blows it out. Before the action is even completed, however, Lean has cut to a shot of a desert vista, with the sun slowly rising over the lip of the horizon. It\\'s one of the most famous elliptical edits in cinema history, second maybe only to the bone/spaceship cut in \"2001: A Space Odyssey.\" And it\\'s only the first of countless memorable moments in \"Lawrence of Arabia.\" The appeal of David Lean epics has always been his ability as a director to maintain an equilibrium between the scope of his films and the characters in them. Character development is never sacrificed to massive set pieces or knock-your-socks-off action sequences. \"Lawrence of Arabia\" has these elements too, but at heart it\\'s a character study of one remarkable man. Lean seemed to understand that impressive landscapes alone are not inherently interesting; but if you place a fascinating character among those impressive landscapes, you can have movie magic.\"Lawrence\" feels unlike other historical epics of its time. In most \"big\" films--I\\'m thinking of movies like \"Ben-Hur,\" \"Spartacus,\" \"Cleopatra,\" all movies that premiered roughly around the same time as \"Lawrence\"--one gets the sense that directors framed compositions based on how much they were able to fit into their widescreen lenses. One rarely sees characters filmed from anything closer than a medium shot, and usually the background is stuffed to overflowing with garish art direction. Everything feels static and wooden. But in \"Lawrence,\" Lean keeps his frames constantly alive by juxtaposing huge landscape shots with extreme close-ups of actor faces. In one especially brutal scene, after a battle that results in the slaughter of many people, the action cuts to a close-up of O\\'Toole, looking panicked and crazed, gripping a bloody knife in his hand as if he\\'s reluctant to drop it, obviously both disturbed and titillated by the carnage he just witnessed. It\\'s moments like that---not just an impressive battle scene but a character\\'s reactions to the results of that scene---that set \"Lawrence\" apart from other standard epics.And of course, I have to reserve space in my review for the performance of Mr. O\\'Toole. He is perhaps my favorite actor, not one of the most prolific, but certainly one of the most unpredictable. He has a flair for choosing eccentric characters that give him almost unlimited room in which to perform. He carries \"Lawrence of Arabia\" almost singlehandedly on his slim shoulders. That\\'s not to say the supporting cast isn\\'t great, but O\\'Toole towers above them all. O\\'Toole understands that the most influential figures in history could also be the most difficult and ruthless when they needed to be, and he gives Lawrence an incredibly complex characterization, leaving his audience in doubt as to whether he should be worshipped or feared, or perhaps both.Lean would never direct an equal to \"Lawrence of Arabia\" again. His later films are certainly more than watchable, and \"A Passage to India\" is even quite remarkable in its own way, but we would never get another \"Lawrence.\" Even more reason to appreciate it now.My Grade: A+',\n",

The all-consuming \"dark love story\" (Hans Zimmer, MUSIC) between \"Clarice\" (Julianne Moore\\'s more-experience, hence more disillusioned) \"Starling\" and her dark guardian-angel, \"Hannibal,\" at first enjoying his \\'Paradise Re-gained\" of Florence (\"with a view\"), is given its just due in this film adaptation.And there IS a great amount of the psychological battle-of-wits involved in \"Dr. Lecter\\'s\" subtle \\'seduction-of-Evil\\' correspondence (from the obligedly-chaste \\'courtly-love\\' distance of a FBI fugitive, far from his \"straight arrow\" Special Agent); doomed as they might appear, to never consummate their affair as \"star-crossed lovers\" (Ridley Scott). There, we might see one critical departure; i.e., for that (the Shakespearean) pair of ill-destined lovers in the different corrupt \"City State\" (\"Fair Verona\" rather than \"Florence\"/\"Washington, D.C.\") ! Which explains, perhaps, certain departures. What IS masterfully maintained is the corruption !Apart from all the evidence of Dantean \\'poetic justice\\' retributions, which the film takes straight from the novels, there is the serious flaw of attributing \"the mash note\" (even if it\\'s being on a postcard of a particular William Blake painting IS a fine touch !) to \"Mason Verger\" (\"He didn\\'t write it, because I did !\"-- Gary Oldman); i.e., to his fraudulent machinations and manipulation of the Justice Dept. and FBI. The message, in form of Lecter\\'s \\'esoteric\\' Old Testament reference to \"the answer to Samson\\'s Riddle\": \"the honey in the lion,\" is NOT just \\'something Lecter would say\\'. It is the essence of the \\'beatific purity\\' of Clarice, as her \\'Beatrice\\' to Hannibal\\'s \\'Dante\\', among the corrupt and cynical of \"that stale bureaucracy\" of the \"Krendlers\" (Ray Liotta), \"Vergers,\" and others : \"the Philistines\" who would betray \\'the true Israelite\\' at every turn :\"I thought, to begin with, you might tell me how you\\'re feeling.\"\"About what?\"\"The masters you serve and how they\\'ve treated you. Your career, such as it is. Your life, Clarice.\" ...\"You serve the idea of Order, Clarice. They don\\'t. You believe in the oath you took. They don\\'t. You feel it is your duty to protect the sheep. They don\\'t. They don\\'t like you because you\\'re not like them. They hate you and they envy you. They are weak and unruly and believe in nothing.\"Since this exchange captures the sense of Hannibal\\'s elliptic Biblical reference, the alteration can be excused somewhat. Indeed, this very aspect of the film\\'s diegesis (the world of womanly purity bound to corrupt \\'City-State\\') is the option which justifies the decisions on \\'ending\\' (even the \"Never-Before-Seen Alternate Ending\" [DVD]). It may be as simple a thing as the decision that the horrific of \\'the happy cannibal-couple\\' would be too much for audiences : the actual \"New Life\" succumbing of Clarice to the cynical wisdom of our (best of all the previous Hollywood attempts to depict Nietzsche\\'s so-called \"Blond Beast\"/\\'Superman\\') epitome of evil, as an Uebermensch \"beyond Evil.\" And, while the film\\'s ending supports one equally Dantean reading of the story, the novel fully explodes the twisted narrative of perverse chivalry in an almost literal (cannibalistic) reading of the \"New Life\" sonnet\\'s all-consuming passions.\"Then, unaware, she ate his heart.\" (From the novel: \"Inspector Pazzi\" (Giancarlo Giannini), on his \\'high maintenance\\' wife (Francesca Neri).]But the cinematic aesthetic production values are superb, and rich enough in literary culture and historical mise-en-scene to validate the claim to : \"as compelling a film as you will ever see\" (Joel Siegel, \"Good Morning America\") and other accolades.',\n",

With JJ Abrams shifting to directing the other space saga, Fast and Furious guy Justin Lin wears the directorial cap for this one and has done a great job indeed. He has picked up where JJ has left off and it is good to see that there hasn't been much of a difference in the style.Star Trek beyond focuses on yet another mission by the USS enterprise crew. Take it this way: when they are bored, they like to put themselves in danger:) Unfortunately this time, Captain Kirk has to lose his beloved ship in a rescue mission and also risk the capture of his crew. Captain Kirk and his fellow near and dear ones get separated and the rest of the film is about how they make their way out of danger and prevent the villain Krall from destroying.. well you get it. The plot is pretty straightforward unlike its previous movie. Visuals and humour are well handled as usual. There is one epic scene nearing climax which makes makes this movie go from good to 'damn good'. It was very saddening to know about the untimely death of Anton Yelchin just prior to the movie release, and he has a pretty good screen time in this film as well. Audience will experience mixed emotions seeing him as Chekov for one last time. Also, the makers have handled Leonard Nemoy's tribute very intelligently. Although Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto lead the way, it is Karl Urban who steals the show with his sarcastic humour and grunts. Sofia Boutella as Jayla is impressive and Idris Elba cakewalks through the role of the antagonist, Krall. I was surprised to see Simon Pegg is also a writer for this film!Although Start Trek Beyond doesn't take you much 'beyond' it takes you to enough distance to give you a good cinematic experience.\",\n",

If you like 90 minutes of screaming, clumsily grabbing for (and missing) EVERYTHING, and one of those \"what can go wrong WILL go wrong\" movies - this is definitely your kind of flick.Opens up well enough: they\\'re on a mission in space, securing some prototype doodad to the Hubble telescope. But that\\'s where it stops being anything short of obnoxious. A Russian satellite explodes and for some odd reason the debris from the explosion begin to hurdle around the earth at insane speeds - tearing through protective plating designed to take asteroid impacts. Immediately the main character starts having a huge panic attack, and her complete inability to do anything useful leads to the death of her commanding officer. While \"low on oxygen\", you then get to enjoy listening to Sandra Bullock hyperventilate for a good 20 minutes. Then she has major emotional breakdowns throughout the rest of the movie, leading her to do stupid, mindless things. A woman with that many emotional problems would not be allowed to go into space.Everything she does either goes wrong or has the classic clich√© of working right at the last second (I can\\'t even count how many times she missed grabbing a dozen objects but then happens to catch onto the last one). The most frustrating is when she is holding on to her commander\\'s tether, and for some reason he is being pulled away from her continually, despite them being in space. He can\\'t climb up the zero- gravity rope, and she can\\'t pull him back? It\\'s aggravating.So really that\\'s the gist of the entire movie. No character development. Weak script (as many have mentioned). Ludicrously unrealistic. And overall the movie was just one of those \"OH COME ON!!!!\" movies. Will never see it again, and it remains a mystery to me why it got such high ratings...',\n",
              " 'Apollo 13 is a very well-executed, well-directed, and well-funded movie. It has great acting, good story, and a solid theme. However, the film is so enervated and the theme so obvious, that one would naturally wonder if it would be much better if cut shorter. Honestly speaking, I came for Tom Hanks. He is good in this movie, playing a character he is much familiar with by now. Ed Harris as Gene Kranz impressed me a lot. The other characters have all contributed convincing performances, and if rated individually, I would give the acting 8/10. The pacing of the film is horrible. The third act, or the forth act, which I cannot distinguish because the film gets messier as it comes to the end, is the most interesting and compact part in the film. The first and the second act is so overlong and dull. I just do not understand why Ken, as a character, is so important. He does not really help develop the thematic message, and this is not a documentary. If he has to be there, he should only have shown up in the first half of the film, illustrating that in front of the greater good, individuality has to be eliminated. Also in making Ken a character, the film somehow makes the medical team the villain! That is just stupid and confusing, especially when Tom Hanks takes off his medical things and the other two crew members follow. That is just so unprofessional and out-of-character. Now I understand it may have been used to say something about the comradeship, but that is just so clich√© and outdated, even to a film made in say 1950s. Oh the special effects are good. They are very realistic, matching the real ones. So in conclusion, if you are a spaceship fanboy or something like that, this is a great film for you because it is quite realistic; if you are looking for something more impactful or energetic, go to Gravity or The Martian; if you want something more abstract and has a deeper thematic message, 2001: the Space Odyssey is always there for you.',\n",

First off, DiCaprio is a terrible actor no matter which way you look at it. People just like him because of his looks. His acting \"skills\" essentially consist of saying a lot of cheesy lines and trying to act sexy. Second, the film itself had a rather boring and simple plot: girl falls in love with guy, ship they\\'re on sinks, lots of crappy love scenes thereafter. Anyone with an IQ above 50 will realize this isn\\'t ingenious in any way whatsoever. Nor is it original. Plus the director felt the need to drag it out for 3+ hours.

              " \"After seeing many lukewarm or negative reviews, I watched Passengers with low expectations. Having seen it, I'm aware of its logical shortcomings. But overall, I liked it a lot - for reasons I really never expected.At its core, this is not an adventure - it's a very unusual love story. It's about a love born of disaster, desperation and even heinous selfishness. And yet, it's a love that we come to appreciate as the story slowly unfolds. This film works remarkably well on a dramatic level. The two stars are extremely likable, and do a fine job of presenting a wide range of emotions, despite the limited scope of the story. (There are also a few smaller parts that work very well - notably the mechanized bartender.)Even more surprisingly, Passengers succeeds in evoking that bona fide SF 'sense of wonder,' as we contemplate the lives of two people living alone on a huge starship, while 5,000 others remain inaccessible in hibernation. It's a fascinating vision, depicted quite powerfully.On a purely mechanical level, the results are somewhat more mixed. The film does look terrific. The starship is elegant and believable. But the film's respect for real-world physics, on the other hand, hits both highs and lows.On the up side, there are several maneuvers in zero gravity that are really quite clever, handled infinitely better than we've seen in such critically-acclaimed dreck as Gravity (which also lacked the powerful emotional side of Passengers). On the down side, we have a ship that loses centrifugal gravity by suddenly ceasing to spin. Not only is there no reason for it to stop spinning, we don't see the horrible carnage that inertia would create inside the ship after a sudden stop. There's also a scene with fusion plasma that's needlessly implausible, not so much because of poor physics, as because of lazy writing.On balance, however, the scientific underpinnings are more than adequate to carry the film's genuinely compelling drama. Ignore the few inevitable quibbles, and Passnegers works really well as both SF and romance. It leaves you with some novel insights into human nature, and a genuinely haunting central image.I have to deduct a point or two on the technical side, but even so I give the film a very strong recommendation. It's entertaining, likable and thought-provoking, and I will definitely watch it again.\",\n",

The character he seems to always play fits quite well into this film, and I was easily wrapped up in the story.

The CGI was pretty good at points and Didn\\'t look terrible compared to other films I have seen. However, this doesn\\'t carry the film. 90% of this film relies on its humour, and it wasn\\'t very good. The jokes where pretty copy paste, trying to be raunchy and edgy, and were quite pandering. I genuinely didn\\'t laugh or even smirk for any of the jokes. The \"Shit. Did I leave the stove on?\" is such a easy and overused joke, and for a film that is meant to be the best thing since sliced bread, I honestly hoped for better. There is also only about 20 mins of actual story that seems to get mixed in with the flashbacks and action sequences. I Wasn\\'t expecting to be blown away by the story, but I feel that they could of tried a little harder. The flash back scenes really disrupted the flow of the film and made it hard for me to get into the movie as I was just waiting for another flash back at any moment. Now, To be fair, I have only read little segments of the Deadpool comics, but what I did read made me laugh. I had heard from friends and others that this is THE Deadpool that is in the comics and not some film that completely screws up the character. If that is the case, then I am not sure if I want to read the comics. I could go on and nit pick little things and scenes that I didn\\'t like but not many people are going to read this. Overall I would say that fans of Comic book movies will most likely enjoy this.

The Split-Personality of the Killer/Family Man is the Focus and it does Deliver Enough of that to be Convincing. But for a Mob/Hit-man Movie it is all quite Subdued and Subtle. A Character Study that might be Slightly Lacking in the Study of this Sociopaths Character. It is all Surface and Very Little Substance, and the Fine Acting by All Involved is Rendered Rather Limp and the Film seems more like a Snapshot than a Feature Film.Overall, the Performances are worth a Watch Propelled by the Always Fascinating Underbelly of the Human Condition.

Aliens are persecuted, brutally murdered, people suffer, and basically there is nothing really to enjoy in this movie except maybe the occasional humorous subtitle from the Aliens. The whole film is about racism on the alien level.I don't know exactly how anybody in their right mind could call a movie that is completely about either killing or persecution a great film. The greatest films IMHO can be viewed by anyone, not just the male demographic aged 18 to 40. If you were to ask me if I liked anything about this movie, I would say that ironically I really liked the very last scene. Until that last scene the movie was totally and needlessly barbaric and sickeningly intolerable in its xenophobic attitudes.This is not as good as the critics would have you believe, and this movie is certainly not for everybody, and I find the high score on both rottentomatoes and the IMDb here to be totally unwarranted.

I think the fundamental problem is that Lego is a great medium for telling other people's stories, to which the plethora of characters in the film allude (Star Wars, Batman, pirates) but is not really an interesting subject for a story in itself. Although, to say that it's completely lacking in story may be a little harsh as this is largely a copy of The Matrix for 8 year olds. In this case, however, despite the principal character's initial self doubt and the ensuing voyage of personal discovery, it turns out that there actually is nothing special about him. Instead we have a film that panders to the latent insecurity of its audience of yuppy parents whose deepest fear is that their child might not be that special after all. Don't worry though, it turns out that everyone's special with Lego.Additionally, whilst he doesn't appear until towards the end of the film, Will Ferrell's presence can be felt throughout - this film thinks it's hilarious when actually it's just boring, with a boring plot and boring characters polished with some fancy animation.I read a review (in The Guardian) that suggested an underlying message of citizen empowerment, where anyone has the ability to mould and influence the society in which they live. I think that's reading too much into it, it was about buying Lego. This was the first time that I have felt compelled to write a review on IMDb because of the poor quality of a film.

              " 'In order to properly appreciate The Terminator, you have to look at this film and take into consideration the budget that it was made on and the status of the director who created it. Before this film, James Cameron was not the king of the world like he was after Titanic and Avatar broke through. He was a person who very little people had faith in with a film idea that didn\\'t go over very well among the top studios. And if you look at this film from a technical point of view, you can see that they were being conservative with the budget for a bizarre science fiction premise created by a struggling filmmaker who nobody really had much faith in. But in the end, it turned out to be a very good movie with real heart and soul, exciting and suspenseful action, an interesting if unlikely plot, and great performances from Linda Hamilton and Michael Biehn.But what about Arnold Schwarzenegger? Well, Arnold is unique in this film since he is not really a character in the traditional sense. He is more of an obstacle; a force of nature that cannot be stopped that haunts the protagonists with his fierce demeanor and acute focus on his main mission: to murder Sarah Connor. There is an intensity to his presence on-screen, no small part do to Brad Fiedel\\'s excellent score which includes a foreboding metallic heartbeat every time the Terminator walks onto the scene. And fascinatingly enough, his \"character\" as the Terminator encompasses a very dark fantasy of man: the ability to do anything to anyone without any consequences or anyone being able to stop you.The movie hits all the right notes! It starts with a disastrous view of the future before jumping into a dark, disturbing view of the present, with the gritty, dirty streets of nighttime LA providing the perfect setting for a suspenseful chase between man and a murderous machine. It gives us a glimpse of lighthearted humanity as we see Sarah Connor, and ordinary young woman living her life as a normal person, before we are thrown into her nightmare as she finds herself stalked by an unknown assailant with an unknown cause. We feel sympathy for her as she finds herself not only in physical danger but facing the emotional crisis of having the responsibility of saving humanity in the future. And we feel for Kyle Reece, the soldier sent from the future to protect her against impossible odds, as we see him trying to operate in a world that he does not know after growing up in the wake of nuclear destruction. Even the minor characters feel real and human. The only thing \"wooden\" about the acting in the movie would be from Arnold himself, but that\\'s okay because his character is supposed to be a lifeless, emotionless killing machine - and he excels at his role as the Terminator in that way.But despite how much I love this movie (I even love it more than Terminator 2: Judgement Day, believe it or not), I can\\'t ignore the fact that certain elements of the film have not aged well at all! Chase scenes that were filmed and sped up to look faster, choppy stop-motion animations on the Terminator endoskeleton, and prosthetic animatronics with plastic skin are just a few examples of how this film shows its age and its low budget. Setbacks like this can take modern moviegoers out of the experience simply because a lot of the special effects look incredibly dated compared to other films, even films that came before this movie like Return of the Jedi. However, in the end, this film comes across as James Cameron\\'s true labor of love. This isn\\'t the blockbuster high-budget mega production Titanic or Avatar. This is the film that got his name well known among the movie-making industry. This was his equivalent to Spielberg\\'s Jaws or Lucas\\' Star Wars: a film that was so hard to make, but you can see he poured his heart into, and it paid off! You have to respect something like that!Just watch this film! Do it! Do it now! Go! Leave this review and find a copy of The Terminator and watch it!',\n",

He was the best special effects ghost. The Christmas future ghost was more boring. It was only a black shade who doesn't talk and only shows things with his finger without doing anything special. I have to admit that it was the scarriest ghost in the story. That is already one thing of good about it. Christmas present was also a good one. I really liked his power of changing things. He seemed to be the happiest character and looks so much like Santa Claus. He laughs too much and gives us the feeling of smashing him.The ghosts were SO COOL!

              " \"George Lucas is very fond of effects and it shows. And when the first two hours has very little action, but just a lovestory with bad dialogue, you start thinking, what am I doing here.Then there is a war, and the series is back to it's former greatness. Lightsaber-fights not with one, nor two, but every jedi in the universe. Even Yoda lights his saber, and gives us the absolute highlight of the movie.In episode I Jar-Jar broke up great actionsequences with stupid gags. This time around C3PO and R2D2 has teamed up again and interrupts some of the greatest Star Wars action ever. Uneccesary again, but more bearable.The actors of the Star Wars movies have always had to work with bad dialogue. The actors in episodes IV to VI managed it better than the performers in these newest films with only Ewan McGregor as the exception.Without the ending the film would get a rating of 2 from me. With the ending it manages to reach the area between 3 and 4. Not really bad, not great, not even mediocre. As pure entertainment: it works.\",\n",
              " 'Do you believe in fairy tales? In creeps and ghouls and ghosts and boogymen? Do you believe in hope? And joy and love and other things, like children do? If you say no, you will love The rise of the guardians. If you say yes, you will definitely love The rise of the guardians. Dreamworks has pulled out all the stops with this super adorable animated film. It has a great cast voicing the characters but that is not enough is it? So guess what, the film has an awesome story line and some well done graphics as well.For an hour and thirty seven minutes the film twists and turns through fear, sorrow, magic, joy and hope. There is not a single boring minute and for once, for what seems like after a really long time, I found a film completely unpredictable until the very end. Bringing in a concept of what is sadly true, the fact that childhood is dying and with it is hope and faith and childlike belief of whimsical characters like Santa and the Easter Bunny, the Rise of the Guardians gets one thinking about the metaphorical fears and dangers threatening mankind, showcased throughout the entire film.Animation lovers will especially enjoy the final few minutes of the film where there is an obvious interpretation from a scene in The Lion King staring Scar (Let me know if you can find the correlation just like I did ). Bottomline - A must watch for children and adults of all ages.',\n",
              " 'I guess you know the drill already. With the Lord of the Rings making Hollywood studios go into a frenzy in adapting the many fantasy books out there, not everything Tinseltown touched turned to box office gold, and more often than not, save for that famous boy wizard, what could have been pilots of franchises, became no more than false starts. I suppose it goes to show that a solid story is still fundamental, other than making yet another special effects extravaganza to try and wow a growingly jaded audience.So the verdict for Percy Jackson & the Olympians? I dare say I was impressed by how engaging it was, so much so that 2 hours just flew by, but that doesn\\'t mean that it didn\\'t have its fair share of plot loopholes for you to ridicule, or clich√©s that make you chuckle that these are still utilized in this day and age. Simply put, if the Greek gods and goddesses were all powerful, especially that of Zeus, well the first few minutes as played by Sean Bean, made him out to be a clueless weakling who had his all powerful lightning bolt being stolen from under his nose, like taking candy from a kid, and now the kid\\'s throwing a bad tantrum, threatening the fate of the world and that of Olympus (erm, the Empire State Building in New York, anyone?) unless his accused, the titular thief and demigod son of Poseidon (Kevin McKidd) coughs out his favourite toy.But that is only if Percy Jackson (Logan Lerman) is guilty in the first place, given that he actually doesn\\'t know his half-god lineage no thanks to Poseidon being horny enough (as do the other gods in their frequent visits to the human earth) to impregnate Sally Jackson (Catherine Keener), and then Sally deciding to keep Percy safe from jealous harm from other godly beings, because being the son of Zeus, Poseidon and Hades (Steve Coogan) is a big thing actually, the three being big daddies and sworn brothers in this mythology.But of course in one fell swoop, all hell breaks loose, Percy discovers that a Pen can indeed be a powerful weapon, and allies himself with a Satyr Grover (Brandon T. Jackson) his good friend and protector, the cute demigod Annabeth (Alexandra Daddario) - note the necessary trio of heroes in the vein of Harry Potter here given that they\\'re demigods, but still need to go to a Hogwarts equivalent to hone their special abilities, amongst other Greek god offsprings numbering in the hundreds (told you they were horny), in the middle of a nowhere forest, demarcated by a sign board and a force field to keep out muggles, I mean, humans.Being an introductory film to the world of the Olympians, we learn facts like why Percy\\'s such a big deal (no he didn\\'t repel the biggest foe in the franchise), and the little do\\'s and don\\'ts they have to learn from the likes of the centaur Chiron (Pierce Brosnan). But kids being kids, and wanting to save his mom from the clutches of Hell, Percy and his friends embark on an American cross country road trip, and in the meantime try to decipher just who could that Thief be, having 14 days as the deadline to meet, which forms the basis of incidents and episodes that the trio come face to face with in exhibiting their powers (well, actually only Percy\\'s).Part of the fun is to see how other notable names in the casting list get to play up their gods and demon status. Uma Thurman stars as Medusa, spruced up by special effects snakes adorned on her head, which at certain points looked quite CG-ed for its own good. Or having Rosario Dawson star as Persephone in quite fed-up manner, and the lists goes on. Suffice to say that many of the appearances here are quite self contained in the scene they appear in, that they rarely re-appear again until the sequel (already announced for next year). Joe Pantoliano hams it up as Percy\\'s muggle, I mean human step dad, and I was somewhat impressed by the extremely mean looking CG design of Hades, which can really strike fear with his appearance. The one that came out in the bonfire, that is.With Clash of the Titans coming just round the corner, one wonders whether it may suffer from an audience jaded with this version\\'s interpretation of Greek mythology, plus the uncanny use of the same villainous types that would prove detrimental by the time Titans come around. I guess that remains to be seen. Meanwhile, stay tuned when the end credits start rolling, as there\\'s a scene that\\'ll come on as soon as the cast list rolls off. And I certainly have no clue why \"The Olympians\" were dropped from the title of its release here.',\n",

              " 'I really loved the first two movies of the franchise reboot, so I was really excited to see STB but I left the theatre pretty disappointed. Things I had problems with: a lot of the actors seemed as if they were playing Star Trek caricatures as supposed to actual people (Spock, Scotty, Bones, and Chekov for example) which made it hard for me to follow them throughout the story. There are HUGE plot holes in the movie that are really glaring, and every other scene was a dramatic conversation between two characters where one of them learned an incredibly important life lesson and says some clich√© and quotable line over the not so subtle score (ie \"fear of dying is what keeps us alive). It didn\\'t really seem like there were any sincere consequences or obstacles that the characters had to overcome, when only one named character was actually killed throughout all of the catastrophes in this movie, and when so often a character will say that something is impossible, and within five minutes they\\'ll figure out a way around it (with really clich√©d \"I got it!\" moments). Perhaps the biggest problem with the movie is a line that Kirk actually says in the very beginning of the film: this all feels very episodic. This could\\'ve been condensed to a TV show episode, and it would\\'ve worked because there weren\\'t any stakes, nothing drastic had occurred that changed the characters, and you aren\\'t left with any sort of impression as you leave the film. Overall, this is about as average as any other action blockbuster and I can\\'t find anything really exemplary to remark about this movie.',\n",
              " 'Movies like \"Moulin Rouge!\" (or more recently, \"La La Land\") are so lavishly designed and stylishly directed that the simplicity of their stories is no coincidence, they are well-crafted forms of entertainment meant to arouse emotions rather than thoughts.Indeed, while I\\'m not a professional on editing or filmmaking, what I gathered from years of cinematic dedication is that complex, multi-layered, character-driven stories generally call for straightforward directing, so that the form doesn\\'t distract from the content. In other words, there\\'s a time for \"2001: A Space Odyssey\" and another for \"Chinatown\", and I can\\'t think of a good movie that is both exceedingly directed and written (with the exception of \"Citizen Kane\").Can we take for granted that people know \"Romeo and Juliet\" so well that a few artistic licenses won\\'t hurt, or are actually needed? Is it such an iconic story that it can sustain every narrative form without undermining the emotional bingo of the end? Well, I\\'m not sure the story is self-sufficient, while watching Leo as Romeo (talk about predestination in that rhyming) challenging Tybalt (John Leguizamo), shouting Shakespeare\\'s lines with such passion I could hardly understood what he said, I was wondering if the movie wouldn\\'t have worked as well or better had they been swords instead of guns, Verona instead of Verona Beach and good old Renaissance as the time setting.And it\\'s precisely because Leonardo Di Caprio was an excellent Romeo, in his pre-\"Titanic\" fame years with the youthful charm, the wide-eyed innocence, the eyebrow-raising enthusiasm and penetrating sadness, he was a baby-faced young man who could easily pass as a teenager. The rest of the casting was competent, honorable mention to Leguizamo who looked as passionately angry as his 1968 counterpart Michael York, and to Paul Sorvino and Pete Postlewhaite. Claire Danes paled in comparison but not to the point of ruining the film. What did spoil the film a little was actually its own reason to be, Baz Lhurmann!\" thought that Shakespeare\\'s romance needed a rejuvenation treatment, as if it wasn\\'t modern enough for younger audiences.The problem is that the story has been modernized already, like Kurosawa made adaptations of \"Macbeth\" and \"King Lear\", \"Romeo and Juliet\" inspired good movies like \"West Side Story\" or \"China Girl\", love stories with a gang war as the backdrop. In fact any interesting romance inevitably revolves around star-crossed lovers, any romance owes a bit to \"Romeo and Juliet\" which owed to all the romantic heritage of the past centuries. So you either remake \"Romeo and Juliet\" or you adapt it, there is rarely an in-between solution. Lurhmann took the challenge and it\\'s laudable, but his \"Romeo + Juliet\" couldn\\'t be a total remake or it would have been a second \"West Side Story\", it was doomed to be half-Shakespeare, half-something else.And the problem is that the text didn\\'t match the setting, no matter how hard it tried like replacing the narrator by a TV announcer. It was so busy reminding you that this is the Shakespeare play in its academic version (same lines) that it became unchained to its premise, while in any of the previous adaptations; the romance was the focal point, not its kinship with the original story. It came to the point that the \\'Trainspotting\\'-like editing, the pop music, the opera, the shootouts, the awkward mix between modern settings and Renaissance-expressions becomes a sort of gimmick that overshadowed the story. The form detracted from the story, and the heart of \"Romeo and Juliet\" is the story. If you\\'re not emotionally involved, it\\'s over.And the film could still win the audiences, had it not ruined the very scenes that could create the emotional involvement, through some bizarre experimentation. I didn\\'t care for the 1968 version until the balcony scene; Olivia Hussey\\'s youthful beauty, the purity of Nino Rota\\'s score, the interactions between the young lovers, the film won because of that scene. So, I expected the balcony scene to enhance \"Romeo + Julier\" but Lurhmann had to introduce the novelty of the swimming pool. What was he thinking? If you\\'re going to stick to the play, don\\'t ruin the most iconic part. How can someone be focused on loving while he\\'s also trying to float in the water. Forget what I said, the whole thing just looked awkward and as sincere as the actors were in their intent to play \"Romeo and Juliet\", it\\'s like Lurhmann had another movie in mind.The film was a success but it was out-shined by the Leo\\'s following hit, the one that put him in Hollywood map forever and ever; \"Titanic\" the year after, interestingly, this was a tale of forbidden love that was closer in spirit and in heart to \"Romeo and Juliet\" than \"Lurrhman\\'s jukebox. And Claire Danes, with all due respect, is no Kate Winslet. Leo is a real romantic actor but the real star of Baz Lurhmann\\'s film was Baz Lurhmann. His unique jukebox-styled directing fitted \"Moulin Rouge!\" but as far as \"Romeo + Juliet\" goes, it\\'s still an entertaining little movie, that nostalgic of the 90\\'s will cherish. For me, it\\'s the film of that \"Love Fool\" song and I have it on my playlist.',\n",

When they are caught and captured by FBI agent Richie DiMaso, they are given a choice; either go to jail or help him with 4 additional arrests.

What worked, all of the technical stuff like production design, costume design, visual effects & music all of which should be in the running for some Oscars. What also worked was Charlize Theron's evil queen,over the top but every time she's on you are focus on her, Chris Hemsworth's huntsman,he's basically playing medieval Thor but he's good at it, & even Kristen Stewart's Snow White for most of it, I was really liking through out with the exception of one sense were she is giving a speech, all of the dwarfs were great,and it's also amazing to see how they have darken up this tale.

Opening in England during WW II and the London blitz 12-year-old Peter (Levi Miller, an excellent actor!) is an orphan having been left as a baby on the doorsteps of a Catholic orphanage by his mother (Amanda Seyfried). Peter is a mischievous 12-year-old boy with an irrepressible rebellious streak who with his best friend attempt an unsuccessful escape but discover that every night certain boys are missing from their beds. One incredible night, Peter is likewise whisked away from the orphanage and spirited off to a fantastical world of pirates, warriors and fairies called Neverland where he is befriended by Tiger Lily (Rooney Mara), a new friend in James Cook (Barrett Hedlund), and encounters the pirate Blackbeard (Hugh Jackman). Amidst the fun and danger, Peter ultimately discovers his destiny -- to become the hero who will be forever known as Peter Pan.This is a film of fantasy and requires releasing disbelief in order to become involved with the premise of a prequel to Peter Pan.

The movie looks good visually and has some great action sequences. The action sequences are stunning and outstanding.The main story plot is very unconvincing.The villains and negative characters of the movie are very under developed and the movie suffers from these underdevelopment of characters that somewhat stop the movie from being a epic masterpiece in terms of story plots and negative characters. Some scenes and sub plots seems to overloaded with dull and boring screenplay and feels uninteresting. The humour is good but feels forced at some times and there are few unnecessary characters with make the movie underwhelming and irritating. But, there were lots of better enjoyable and redeeming moments and surprising good action visual elements, with better pacing, some strong solid better acting and even some actually interesting scenes that makes Thor: The Dark World an enjoyable visually stunning Marvel Movie worth to watch.(Please Note: That This Review represent only my professional point of view and my personal honest opinion about the film, and does not represent others.

              " \"Please take 5 min to see if u agree with meUm Where do I begin. There is just too much flaws in this movie. 1. The story 2. The characters 3. Story yup story again.1. The story is just plain n stupid, no heart warming or touching of any source. While watching the movie as a Wolverine fan, the story just seem to b writing by a non wolverine fan. It's like the writer doesn't even know how his power work. His body is like a fruit, everyone slice and stab into in every fighting scenes. He lucky that he has his healing power or else he dead in every fight. That just show that he not a good fighter. OH I for got, even without his healing power, he got shot like 10 time, even to the chest n he still move around like he has his healing power. What the fuk was that about. 2. Many of the character in this movie are just lame n stupid. The viper woman is just god damn stupid n does not fit into anything. She just going around poison people and act like a bitch through the whole movie. where does she fit in, what in it for her. Secondly a giant silver samurai, oh it turn out to be grandpa, the guy he saved at the beginning of the movie. The red hair girl, oh my god, she is just an ugly Japanese girl. They could at least hire a prettier girl to look at. Damn she ugly. 3. I cant seem to like the story at all. The man he saved turn out he wanted to steal wolverine power. The grandpa is evil, the father wanted his own daughter dead, oh get this, he wanted her dead because the will is on her name, from grandpa to her. The daughter kill grandpa at the end, but during the movie she break apart because he is in bed rest. At one point she wanted to run off a clip, suicide attempt. At the end she chose wolverine over her own grandpa that she been breaking apart from. She throw wolverine own claw like a knife into grandpa head. Who the fuk does that to there grandpa. The really sick part about his movie is that wolverine hooking up with the grandpa grand daughter. Let see he saved grandpa 40 years ago, so grandpa could go home and have kids, and his kid have kid which is his grand daughter and wolverine fuk his grand daughter. Sick Sick Over all not a bad movie, lot of good action, but story is just a bunch of pot hole.\",\n",
              " 'When science fiction meets romantic drama in a Hollywood film, one of them almost always suffers. Writers either lack the skill to pull off the combination in a way that\\'s mutually reinforcing and consistent, or they lack faith in movie audiences to comprehend what they\\'re watching without lots of pace-killing exposition. In the case of \"Adjustment Bureau\" we have the added Hollywood trope of political intrigue. The result is only occasionally enjoyable. The rest is just a mess.What\\'s enjoyable are the performances of fine actors making the best of some sketchy material. Damon seemed a natural for the Norris character, even though he\\'s done better work in the \"Bourne\" films. The interplay between him and Blunt is completely authentic on screen. Mackie, Slattery and Kelly are very good also, and Terence Stamp is always good for that suave, menacing role. Unfortunately, the script seems more focused on humanizing the \"adjusters\" than in filling out the other characters. Oh, there\\'s tons of back story on Norris and his family, mostly from Mackie, but the relationship between long-ago events and present-day reality seems either forced or tenuous. Blunt\\'s Elise character has no back story at all, and her front story is strikingly one-dimensional. The main problem, though, is simple logic. We\\'re told that the Bureau has \"the story\" and is simply \"adjusting\" its characters to keep to the plot. But the plot keeps changing, apparently, and it never makes sense to me. Both Slattery and Stamp seem to have telekinetic powers (if only to make people fall down) as well as a sort of omniscience. Why, then, are they so powerless to prevent a simple kiss, or to predict that one of their agents will secretly aid Norris? Why does Stamp, after telling the Damon character why the powers-that-be can\\'t trust lowly humans to manage their affairs through free will, minutes later send him on his way to prove his point? Why is Norris\\' political career so important to them? And the hat thing: why not just get an extra hat for Elise? I could go on, but suffice it to say that there are inconsistencies, plot holes and loose threads galore.One personal peeve of mine is the obligatory celebrity cameo, specifically media figures who seem to appear in every single movie with a political angle -- even when, as here, politics plays a minor part in the story. It no longer adds verisimilitude to a film, if it ever did; it\\'s just a clich√©. And a self-defeating one, because many filmgoers these days don\\'t watch CNN and have no idea who James Carville is. In coming years nobody will even remember these people, let alone recognize them.I don\\'t discount the problems inherent in making a story like this accessible to easily distracted audiences. I don\\'t even want every question raised by the story answered. I just want the story to be internally consistent, to make sense on some level. It can be done, it has been done before. But not this time.',\n",

Basically a magic raindrop falls to the ground and creates a new magical flower that can heal injuries, cure the sick and prolong youth, the elderly Gothel (Spider-Man 2\\'s Donna Murphy) wants this flower herself to give her everlasting youth and beauty. But the flower is taken by the kingdom palace guards looking for a cure for the sick and dying pregnant queen, and after being cured by the flower\\'s magic, she gives birth to the baby girl, Rapunzel, who absorbs the flower\\'s abilities in her golden hair. Finding this out, Gothel kidnaps the baby in order to use the powers of her hair for herself, and she takes her to a hidden tall tower that is well hidden and no-one will ever find to raise her as her own daughter. Eighteen years later, Rapunzel (A Walk to Remember\\'s Mandy Moore) has grown her hair to a humongous length, and she still believes the horrible Gothel is her mother, and with the insistence of her mother stays trapped in the tower to spend her time singing, painting, reading, and looking out the window wondering what is outside. She finally plucks up the courage to ask her \"mother\" about the lights she sees rising in the sky every year on her birthday, she doesn\\'t know they are floating lanterns released from her real home at the palace, hoping she will one day return home. Of course Gothel strictly forbids Rapunzel from leaving tower being greedy for the power of the hair, but soon enough when she is alone, dashing thief Flynn Rider (Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakquel\\'s Zachary Levi) climbs the tower to hide. Desperate to see the rising lights up close, and with her \"mother\" gone for three days, she makes a deal with Flynn that if he takes her to where the lights come from, she will give back the priceless crown he has stolen. So begins a treacherous journey to the kingdom, Rapunzel has mixed feelings about disobeying her \"mother\" and leaving the tower, but she knows she has dreamt of leaving for years, and Flynn is very wary for his sake as well, being a wanted man. When she returns to the tower, and gets back up via the secret entrance, Gothel sees that Rapunzel has been taken away, she at first believes she has been kidnapped, but then she spots her \"daughter\" singing about her relief to be out. After so many chases towards the kingdom, the two thieves that were originally with Flynn join Gothel to capture both him and Rapunzel, they do manage to get to a boat and see the floating lanterns, and they are getting very close as well. Rapunzel is fooled however into thinking that Flynn does indeed still want to crown, he is tied up and captured ready for execution (by hanging), and she is taken back to the hidden tower believing her \"mother\" was right all along. But Flynn manages to escape, and rides back on once rival now friend horse Maximus, while Rapunzel finally realises that she is princess to the king and queen, and of course that Gothel kidnapped her for her hair\\'s abilities. In the end, when Flynn is near death he cuts Rapunzel\\'s hair, turning it brown and taking away its power, Gothel falls from the tower to her death, Rapunzel saves Flynn from death with the flower abilities in her tears, and she returns to her true home to marry Flynn.

Although some scenes from Episode IV were, in a fantastic way, reutilized for this one.Another important aspect that was lacking in The Force Awakens was the music. Much better than the one in Episode VII; there are memorable tracks and even references and new versions of classics, like that Imperial March coming back to us. Then we have those CGI that bring back old characters into the story, which might shock us at first but then we get used to them. We might be conflicted whereas we like it or not, but we cannot deny that they are part of the story and we like feeling nostalgic.As for the characters, they are solid characters very well-played by their actors. I specially like Felicity Jones as she is a great actress and here she delivered a brilliant performance in terms of Star Wars.It is needed to mention that if you are going to watch the movie just for some lightsablers fights, you better turn around and there is almost to none Jedis and no sable fights. Remember, this happens way after Revenge of Sith and right before New Hope, so the Jedis are extinct. The movie is more like the Battlefront video game and separates itself from the rest of the saga. But that doesn't mean that is bad, quite the contrary, it is something different that might inspire you as a non Jedi. We must remember that is a Star Wars story, not a Star Wars Episode. Therefore, it might lack aspects like space fauna and as said the jedis, but it keeps having the Force around it, the spaceships, the Empire, the Rebellion, and it is an interesting story to learn as it gives some answers regarding the original movie. Answers that we might not want to know or that we didn't care at all. But answers that are the excuse to make this entertaining movie.You will leave the cinema wanting to join the rebels and fight against the Empire. As that is (sadly) not possible, you will have to settle to rewatch A New Hope, because of course that is what you want to see, how the story continues (although you already know that). And of course once you start with Episode IV, you will have to continue with V and VI.#JoinTheRebelionAnd now we wait 365 days for Episode VIII.\",\n",
              " 'I was curious about this movie because it\\'s one of the more \"recent\" Vietnam movies so I wanted to see if it brought anything new to the table that the classic movies did not. The movie opens with a French patrol in Vietnam in 1954, the final year of the First Indochina war. The French patrol is overrun by the Viet Minh forces and the commander order to \"kill all they send, and they will stop coming\". We fast forward 11 years when the United States is fighting the Vietnam War. Lieutenant Colonel Hal Moore (Mel Gibson) arrives with his family and is very dedicated to training his troops in preparation to be sent to battle. He will be leading a newly created air cavalry unit (flying troops and supplies in with helicopters) into the Ia Drang Valley. Moore only has 395 men at his disposal and soon learn that the enemy has much more men. Vastly outnumbered, will the astounding leadership qualities and stubborn determination of Moore be enough to survive the coming onslaught?Overall I enjoyed this movie, but not tremendously. The war action was very good, the acting and portrayal of the characters was decent and at times it gave me the feeling of being in the heat of the battle. But it started really slow, the first 40 minutes were not very interesting and although it did setup some story arcs, overall it could be much shorter or be made more exciting. In my opinion they tried to hard with focusing on the families of the soldiers. I understand that they wanted to show how the women left behind would react to the bad news but it didn\\'t work for me, I think they should have stayed with the battle the whole movie. And where most classic Vietnam movies focus on the insanity of war and the dehumanization, this movie sometimes looks like a commercial to join the army. There were a bit to many \"I\\'m glad I died for my country\" moments and it lacked emotional torment of the characters. On the other hand they did a fine job showing the Vietnam troops as real people and not as nameless monsters. Overall it is a decent movie but it doesn\\'t do anything new and doesn\\'t hold a candle to the classic Vietnam movies like Apocalypse Now, Platoon and Full Metal Jacket.',\n",
              " 'SPOILERS So it comes to this. Another sequel of a decent one off movie. I\\'d love to know how much of the decision to make this movie was down to the American studios. Distinctively more of an Anglo American project than the first movie, \"28 Weeks Later\" is a weaker movie attempting to blatantly create a series out of an original one off concept. Continuing the violence and gore of it\\'s predecessor, however distinctively less character driven, it is a suitable Americanisation of a British concept. It\\'s freaky and sometimes fun though.Half a year has passed since the original outbreak of the virus. With Britain quarantined and the majority of the population dead or relocated, the infected have died out. With an American lead NATO force clearing out the Isle Of Dogs in London, so begins the gradual re-population of our fair country. With an American military assuming that everything is under control and civilians increasing in numbers, you just know that things are going to go wrong. So begins the onslaught.It\\'s remarkable how a film can repeat so many ideas and yet get them so hideously wrong. Just like the original film, here we have a deserted London (how the hell they managed to make certain places so devoid of life, I do not know) with landmarks left to grow aged and untouched. Just like the scene on the bridge in the original, so we have major landmarks shot beautifully with a grainy camera. Whether Canary Wharf itself, or more traditional locations like Big Ben and St Pauls, so we have venues which I know and love. Yet, unlike our original film, these are not clever, subtle moments, no, instead at times it is like we are watching some form of holiday programme working for the Tourism Board. Walking across the Millennium Bridge, for example, is completely unnecessary. Yet it feels like the location is added purely for the hell of it.Most notable in the flawed advertisements of London is the use of Wembley. Filmed prior to the completion (Another example of the slow building affecting events), the interior of the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff was used instead. To most I confess this would not be obvious, but to anyone who has watched the FA Cup, or a rugby match, or any sporting event at that venue, the switch is pathetically obvious. If the filming couldn\\'t have been done inside the stadium, change the script.Away from the locations chosen, the story just isn\\'t as good as the original either. So good because of the characterisation, the first film was a joy to watch. Shocking, unnerving, but ultimately brilliant, it developed characters fully, and then bumped them off without much of a fuss. Yet in this second chapter, blatantly following on the American style, here we have badly developed individuals killed in a beautiful moment of poetry. Well, that\\'s the intention anyway. The ultimate flaw here is that this concept is the wrong way round. Like in the original, people are interesting beings, with lives, histories, and generally a personality. They are also ridiculously mortal and can die in an instant. So, how come in this film, they are all shallow, weak, basic characters who appear to fight through multiple scenarios and come out on top. It\\'s insane, and closer to a Die Hard movie than real life.Another complaint, albeit slightly less important than characterisation and location, is the way that a powerful song from the first film has quickly become a soundtrack.In the first film, as we all remember, and if you are like me, adore, Jim invades the military compound to one hell of a good piece of music. Building up slowly but surely, this tune aided the film and developed subtly. It didn\\'t overwhelm, it appeared purely once, and it fitted perfectly. So on to the sequel, and again we have it. Yet no longer is this piece of music gradual and poetic, now it has become a soundtrack piece to be used half a dozen times whenever something \"scary\" happened. Over used, it looses it\\'s power. Yes we wanted to hear it again, just like how we wanted to see the virus take form, and see a few subtle landmarks, but like everything else of beauty in the first film, it is smeared on here in excessive proportions.It\\'s a weary route to try to bring back some sort of reprieve for this film now. So flawed in so many ways, I want to leave it be, and yet, like I said in my introduction, there are good sides to it. Well, one good side. Basically, it\\'s fun, and it does hit the occasional right note.Much more low brow than the first film, for all it\\'s flaws, \"28 Weeks Later\" does provide the adrenaline rush required. Gruesome and often violent, it does leave you with an uneasy feeling. Like many other Zombie films, it is out to satisfy the blood lust which we possess, and it does that well. It also possesses the occasional joke, and allows us our brief British Xenophobic dislike for the Americans. It pushes those buttons rather well in fact. Like I\\'ve said though, it is distinctively low brow. Whilst the first film was a near masterpiece of British cinema, this effort feels distinctively more like a middle of the road American gore-fest.All in all, \"28 Weeks Later\" is a bit of a disappointment. Vastly inferior to the original in all the ways that made it a classic, it is a violent movie with minimal characterisation, excessive tourism agenda, and an overuse of a subtle tune. If you want a blood bath though, and feel like walking out of there with a dislike for everything American (including the woeful set up for a third film), then you are in luck as it does these well.',\n",
              " \"This is a slow moving story. No action. No crazy suspense. No abrupt surprises. If you cannot stand to see a movie about two people just talking and walking, about a story that develops slowly till the very end and about lovey-dovey romance, don't waste your time and money. On the other hand, if you're into dialog, masterful story telling, thought provoking ideas and finding true love in the fabric of life then this is your movie. I recommend you watch this movie when you are most alert, though, because the pace, the music and the overall tone of the movie can put you in a woolgathering mood. It's truly fantastic. I really mean that.Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy are annoying with their mannerisms at times but, thankfully, the chemistry between the two makes the acting very natural, warm and tender. They act and feel each other out from the very beginning, making you feel as an intruder.In their conversations there are excellent commentaries on many subjects that will provoke thought and conversation between you and your partner. I thought it was too deep and too diverse for such young characters but I may be underestimating their intelligence. Still it did not ruin the movie.The overall story is very simple which I think gives the movie it's charm and ultimately it's power.BOTTOM LINE: The movie's flow is slow. The dialog is fascinating. The story builds gently, systematically and substantive. The build up to the finale is satisfying and in the end rewarding.\",\n",
              " 'Witnessing the birth of a new Disney princess is exciting. But when it\\'s paired with a well executed \"good Disney film formula\", you have something beautiful. Which is the fairest word I can describe this film with. It\\'s quite unfair to review a Disney film the same way you review any other film. One must review each aspect of the formula that were binded together to create the emotional Disney experience.1- The Princess : Moana is your typical modern day Disney princess even if she doesn\\'t look like one. She\\'s the curious, kind and courageous girl that wants to break free and defy her parents to seek something she\\'s been longing for. 2- Music / an original catchy song : The Music in Moana was my first Lin Miranda experience. And I Loved it! . Some may disagree, but the music throughout this film was superb and in my opinion, the best aspect of it. We\\'ll definitely be hearing \"How Far I\\'ll Go\" everywhere in the next few months. So cover your ears if you don\\'t want to hate it. It will probably snatch best original song from Zootopia\\'s \"Try Everything\" as well.3- The plot/conflict : Moana, with the help of the demigod Maui, sails on a journey to return the heart of Ti-Fiti in order to stop the corruption that has spread across the ocean and destroyed nearby islands. For a Disney film plots are one of the last things you remember. Since it\\'s all about the experience this plot is simple and does the job.4- The Prince or Male Character : When I saw a couple of Maui scenes in the trailers I thought they were a bit forced. But I\\'m glad I was proved wrong. His jokes no matter how cheesy they might sound work great in the film. Much of that is thanks to Dwayne Johnson\\'s excellent performance.. Maui grows on you as a character, and has great chemistry with Moana. I could watch them conversing on a boat for hours.5- Animal Side Kick : If you know some of the basic chicken behaviors, you are in for a treat. The chicken side kick in this film has some of the funniest scenes. They were well timed and simply creative. 6- The CG and Animation : If I write down every synonym for beautiful, It won\\'t be enough to describe how gorgeous the CG and Animation was in this film. It\\'s amazing to see how it has evolved throughout the years.7- The journey : This is undoubtedly the hardest part to execute. especially when you have a dozen of writers working together. For Moana this was executed well. Usually the parts or sequences that drag an Animated Film down reside in the third act. But for Moana, The third act was my favorite part of the film. There were a couple of sequences in the first half involving \"pirates\" and a crab monster that personally felt unnecessary . I\\'m sure some would enjoy them more though.Overall this film is gladly what I expected it to be. A Disney Classic. It might not be as timeless as Beauty and the Beast or Cinderella. But It surely is a great addition to the collection and a perfect Thanksgiving Cinema Experience.',\n",
              " \"In my ignorance I'm unable to say whether or not this is the Coen brothers' best work; but of those I've seen, it outpaces `Miller's Crossing', outdazzles `The Hudsucker Proxy', and waltzes over `Fargo' - and they were all good movies, too.Barton Fink is a talented, na√Øve, left-wing playwright who at the start of the film (mid 1930s) is enjoying some modest success and is being courted by Hollywood, although he's reluctant to leave New York. We, too, are reluctant for him to leave New York. We know, as deep down he knows as well, that from the moment the ink is dry on the studio contract his whole life, slowly but surely, will spiral down the drain, into the sewer, and beyond.And so it does. It's all done with a fine attention to detail, for Fink is as mindful of the little things as the Coen brothers are. It's not enough that he live in a crummy hotel room with the wallpaper peeling off - the wallpaper must make NOISES as it peels off, and then peel off only half way, and hang precariously while Fink watches in an agony of suspense. I have only begun to describe the finer points of Fink's torture. And the strange thing is, every moment of it is riveting.Of course, all the big things go wrong as well, for which Fink himself is, in a way, to blame. As with all great tragedies the hero has one minor flaw for which he is unmercifully punished. But we like Barton. We forgive him his unimportant faults. At any rate, they're not the reason we take such guilty pleasure in his destruction. It's not because we're sadists, either. We're simply responding to quality. The Coen brothers have fashioned a witty, cast-iron script; a good use has been found for John Goodman (who I never thought much of until I saw this film); and John Turturro keeps our eyes glued in affection to the title character.We also get to see that great rat-faced guy from `Fargo'. I don't even want to know his name. I'll just continue thinking of him as the rat-faced guy from `Fargo'.\",\n",
              " \"Andy (superb Tim Robbins) is condemned to stay all his life in prison due to two murders he has not done. There, he will meet Red (Morgan Freeman, impressive, these is one of the best relation love/friendship of all the movies I've ever seen). Red understand perfectly Andy and guides him at the first moments, as we see Andy from Red's eyes, his loyalty and admiration. We understand all these only by his looks and his moves, in one of the best parts of Freeman. Robbins play the part of a distant character, brave, righteous, intelligent, but as everyone, weak, frightened. It's like an angel in the depht of hell. The hardness of the prison and the corruption of the prison system is perfectly told to us by Darabont perfectly. Its realism is sometimes disgusting and the hardest scenes touches you at the depht of your heart. The film has a very high dramatic part, but in any moment becomes too sweety. Its wonderful dialogues, its magnificent study of characters and their psychologies, the charisma of Robbin's character, well absolutely everything helps that this film becomes part of the selected group of every time masterpieces. There are two scenes that I've loved a lot. The one where, Andy is able to listen, relaxed to a Mozart's Opera in the director prison's office (although being in prison, at that moment, Andy is free). And the other where, one of the prisoners, being very old and having spend almost all his life in prison, commits suicide as he cannot get used to a life in freedom. However, despite all the hardness and the few holes to hope that there's in the movie, at the end there's always a little ray of light. The Shawshank Redemption is that, a chant for life, for our dreams... a masterpiece.\",\n",
              " 'I agree with some posters that the plot was full of holes. Big ones. However, I still enjoyed \"Girl on a Train\" from 2015. I didn\\'t read the book.Rachel (Emily Blunt) is an alcoholic who, since losing her job, spends her days going back and forth on the train past her old neighborhood. There she sees a loving couple, Scott and Megan (Luke Evans and Haley Bennett). Also in that neighborhood is the house she used to live in where now, her ex-husband Tom (Justin Theroux) lives with his new wife Anna (Rebecca Ferguson) and their new baby.Megan is actually the nanny of Anna\\'s and Tom\\'s new baby. One day she abruptly quits. Rachel is envious of Megan\\'s relationship with her husband which is so loving. One day she sees Megan with another man on their porch and becomes enraged. Later on, Megan disappears. Rachel has been seen in the neighborhood, stalking Tom and Anna -- and at one point, picked up their baby and took her outside. She falls under suspicion by the detective in charge (Allison Janney) - the theory being that she attacked Megan in the woods thinking she was Anna as the two are blond and resemble one another.I really enjoyed this film and didn\\'t find it at all boring. The acting was excellent - Blunt walks around most of the time with a dazed and half-dead look on her face, but she has scenes in flashback that are quite different. Theroux and Evans have the showiest roles and rise to the occasion. This isn\\'t a difficult mystery to figure out, but it does keep you involved. A reviewer on this site mentioned one hole which actually didn\\'t turn out to be one after all. The other question is, why wasn\\'t she charged with kidnapping when she took the baby outside? I have to think it\\'s because Anna and Tom wrote her off as a pathetic nut - and she did put the baby down. Rather than make a fuss, they didn\\'t press charges. As to why she didn\\'t have a restraining order - yes, major hole, because she could have had one and violated it anyway. Worth seeing.',\n",
              " \"Tropic Thunder is sharp, funny and very entertaining comedy which gives no mercy to the actors or the people involving to the film making.Opening sequence gives many laughs. It doesn't really mock the great war movies but ables the film makers to show how great parts can be used again with funny spices in the mix. The rest is the big party of great performances. The plot has been thought very well. There is a one action star, one funny man and of course you have to have a method actor. Robert Downey Jr hits the home run as the serious drama, method actor from Australia (Hmmm... I wonder who have they had on their mind?) who takes the acting on the whole new level. It isn't no wonder Downey Jr. was noticed by the Academy Awards and for a such a funny performance! Tom Cruise parties in the role of a producer with a mean mouth. Other cast is also in the order.In the movie there is so much great stuff that a great movie buff can really enjoy. I am a great fan of the Academy Awards and it is always funny when someone questions the criteria what movies or performances gets the nominations.Tropic Thunder is one of the most funniest movies in the of 2008!

              " 'To celebrate my 1000th review for IMDb, I turn to another favourite film. \"Life of Brian\", the third Monty Python film, follows the formula used with great success in the second, \"Monty Python and the Holy Grail\", namely that of telling a story, loosely based upon historical fact or legend, though a series of sketches.The title character is Brian Cohen, a young Judean living during the first century AD. He joins the People\\'s Front of Judea, a small group fighting to free the country from Roman occupation. After a series of misadventures, Brian is mistaken for the Messiah by a crowd of followers and ends up being crucified. Brian is frequently confused with Jesus Christ; the two men were both born in stables in Bethlehem on the same day, and the film opens with the Magi mistakenly coming to offer their homage to Brian, before realising their error.The film was hugely controversial when it came out in 1979, with numerous religious groups accusing the Pythons of irreverence; in a notorious television debate John Cleese and Michael Palin were forced to defend it against Malcolm Muggeridge and the Bishop of Southwark. These accusations had the predictable effect of increasing interest in the film, and thereby boosting cinema attendances, but they also highlighted a possible legal problem. Two years earlier, Britain\\'s once-moribund blasphemy laws had been successfully revived by the anti-pornography campaigner Mary Whitehouse in a prosecution against the magazine \"Gay News\". Fear of a similar prosecution meant that the Pythons had to be careful not to be seen attacking Christ himself; it is always made clear that Brian and Jesus are two separate people and that it is the hapless Brian who is being lampooned. The nearest the film comes to criticising Christian doctrine is during the \"Sermon on the Mount\" scene where Christ\\'s words are misheard or misunderstood by his listeners. (\"Blessed are the cheesemakers\" \"Well, obviously it\\'s not meant to be taken literally; it refers to any manufacturers of dairy products\").Nevertheless, the film does contain a good deal of religious satire, aimed at those forms of organised religion which are intolerant of opposing viewpoints or refuse to permit critical scrutiny of their own dogmas. This is shown in the early scene where an elderly man is about to be stoned for blasphemy, having said \"that piece of fish was good enough for Jehovah\", and more importantly in the scene where the crowd take Brian for the Messiah. This new religion only lasts for a short while, but during its brief existence it mimics some of the less admirable features of real-life religions, such as the tendency to split into competing, mutually hostile sects and the attribution of miraculous or mystical significance to the most mundane words and actions. The mob\\'s faith is not shaken when Brian\\'s divinity is denied not only by his own mother (\"He\\'s not the Messiah, he\\'s a very naughty boy\") but even by Brian himself. (\"Only the true Messiah denies his divinity!\") There is also a good deal of political satire in the film, much of it of a surprisingly conservative nature. The famous \"What have the Romans ever done for us?\" sketch, for example, can be seen as a vindication of British and European colonialism. The political left is parodied by the People\\'s Front of Judea. This tiny organisation, whose lack of significance is equalled only by the self-importance of its members, ostensibly exists to campaign against the Roman occupiers, but expends most of its energies in ideological squabbles against other revolutionary groupuscules such as the Popular Front of Judea and the Judean People\\'s Front. Its bureaucratic mentality means that it is incapable of taking any action without extensive debate and the passing of several motions.Another target of the film\\'s satire is Biblical epics like \"The Greatest Story Ever Told\" or Franco Zeffirelli\\'s \"Jesus of Nazareth\", which generally took a reverential attitude to religion. (Shooting in Tunisia, the Pythons reused some of the sets from Zeffirelli\\'s film). The final crucifixion scene contains an obvious reference to Kubrick\\'s \"Spartacus\". (\"I\\'m Brian and so\\'s my wife!)\" Cleese wanted to play Brian himself, but this role eventually went to Graham Chapman, leaving Cleese free to play his normal gallery of pompous authority-figures, including Reg, the leader of the PFJ, and the centurion who, after catching Brian painting the slogan \"Romans Go Home!\" in incorrect Latin (\"Romanes eunt domus\") forces him to paint the grammatically correct version \"Romani ite domum\" 100 times. There are also memorable contributions from the other Pythons, including Terry Jones (who also directed) as Brian\\'s shrewish mother Mandy, Eric Idle in his normal wisecracking \"Mr Cheeky\" personality and Palin as the camp, lisping Pontius Pilate (\"the little wascal has spiwit\") and as the ineffectual public-schoolboy Roman officer Nisus Wettus. (\"Crucifixion? Out of the door, line on the left, one cross each\"). Idle\\'s other great contribution to the film was to write the closing song \"Always Look on the Bright Side of Life\", which has since taken on a life of its own, being played at football matches, weddings and funerals, including Chapman\\'s.\"Life of Brian\" came out when I was a teenager, and as like most British teenagers of the period I was a huge Python fan I enjoyed it enormously. Since then I have watched it regularly, and every time I do I find something new to laugh at or some new subtlety I had not previously noticed. It is, in my view, the best of the Python films and the greatest British comedy of the seventies; it paved the way for the revival of British film-making in the eighties. Several of the greatest films of this revival were to be made by Handmade Films, the company set up by former Beatle (and Python fan) George Harrison to make \"Life of Brian\". 10/10',\n",

              " \"I first need to state that as a Star Wars Fan I'm thrilled to witness all those new sequels,\\nfor instance I didn't praise The Force Awakens however I thought back then that rebooting such an old franchise is a hard task, I really enjoyed Rogue One which I'm thinking is maybe one of the best Star Wars movie ever even compared to the first trilogy.So I've been watching this morning and my words can't describe how much of a letdown I think this movie is.The movie is riddled with pranks, bad humour, making fun of the Star Wars universe in a bad way, I usually like humour but here it's not subtle enough.There are lots of realism issues, for instance people surviving in space with no gear, a single stupidly modded X-Wing taking down a Capital ship, I know Star Wars is a fantasy but this is too much.I feel like the new characters are out of place, I don't get them, moreover, they evolve too quickly, adding to the realism issue.Some creatures, items unveiled into this movie don't add any value to it, they're here just to sell more merchandising itemsThe villains on the dark side are ridiculous, a boy and a creature that could play in one of Disney movies, they really don't compare to Vador nor PalpatineParts of the Story don't make any sense, how come Snoke fleet couldn't keep up with resistance fleet rusty ships?? they chased them for like 8 hours, seriously??Moreover it's still recycled from previous Star Wars Movies.Ship design is not on par with the previous movies.\",\n",
              " 'Heres one you can chalk up to low expectations, but a movie with the unfortunate title of Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle (and look I get it, people still remember the song and it plays with a trailer, but it doesn\\'t play as far as anything remotely clever) is an enjoyable experience. This all comes down to who is involved and, for the most part, how the director uses his cast and resources.Jake Kasdan is not especially known for big Hollywood spectacle on a 100 mil budget (whatever it is if it has Dwayne Johnson and it\\'s *under* 100 mil that\\'s an achievement), but he is known for, to varying degrees of success, his work in comedies like Orange County and the underrated Walk Hard. Kasdan isnt a Joe Johnston, who directed the first moderately successful/hey-its-not-some-nostalgic-classic-its-alright original, so he only has a competent sense of action and effects (theyre not *bad* theyre just competent and adequate and thats fine). What he does have in spades is the ability to get good work out of actors ready to stretch themselves just a little, and thats what you get here with an additional treat: video game meta(ish)ness.In other words, if you pay attention to movies currently and have seen what The Rock and Kevin Hart and (to a smaller extent) Jack Black have done in movies, this subverts that since the concept opens it up; the pitch is almost like, I dunno, Breakfast Club meets Tron but, of course, in a jungle, as four teens (dorks, jock, popular girl, et al) get stuck in a video game during detention and take on avatars of Johnson, Hart, the lovely Karen Gillan and Black and have to take on a mission all aren\\'t quite ready for. Though this does leave us with seeing arcs play out with the original teen actors bookending the movie, they\\'re solid arcs for what is at heart a kids comedy, and it\\'s a comedy that banks on us knowing at least some (if not a lot more) of how we see these actors, for the most part, and what happens when Johnson has to play afraid of everything and Hart is a football star who has his stated video game character \"weakness\" as \"Speed\". Woops.Thats the other thing, on the whole, this movie understands video games likely more than 99% of other video game movies (if one wants to count Scott Pilgrim vs the World as one, and I would up to a point, thats the only one that really digs deep into understanding and satitirizing video games, at least until Ready Player One comes out, that I can think of). When we get a flashback, for example, of Bobby Cannavale\\'s sneering weird-iris-eyed villain\\'s origin a character explains to another that this is what\\'s called a \"cut scene.\" There are also life bars on the characters\\' arms and the uncertainty about what will happen if all the bars are gone and if that means actual death, not just dead-and-come-back, is not a plot hole so much as it works as genuine ambiguity for what these people are in to and for us. And, again, every major actor here is up to so the double work of playing these teen types and what their video game avatars are supposed to do (ie Black\\'s Bethany is a cartographer, to which she states at one point shes a map \"doctor\", so to speak I guess).This is a genuinely clever, funny script that shows Kasdan\\'s skill at mining for comedy based on everything the premise can give him. And it provides a lot for everyone in the cast (save maybe Cannave, who is better than this but whatever he\\'s screen presency) to dig in to, and the arcs for them while a bit obvious are worthwhile and the message of looking past the types into what makes you stronger or more confident or just not, well, a dick to people or others (ie Bethanys self-centeredness or Fridge\\'s stand-offish \\'i dont need to study\\' aspect), works. This doesnt mean everything is as funny as it should be, which is why I said \"for the most part\" before; Jack Black is given one note to play as \"ugh\"-y teen narcissist and it gets a bit tiring when there isn\\'t something completely genius for him to say (which is often). It\\'s to the point where, and I never thought I\\'d say this, Hart gets more or just stronger comedic material than Black does, or knows how to use how we see him to an advantage or whathaveyou. There\\'s also a fifth character midway through that provides some story intrigue and more stakes (it also is a good move via set up and pay off from the opening of the film which may/may not be following up off the original, dont know doesnt matter) and he is serviceable as an actor but doesn\\'t stand out like everyone elae does.This might just be grading on a curve since its far from anything great and isn\\'t without some logical jumps to make - yes, I say this, for a Jumanj maybe standalone rebooquel - such as a thing that happens with a life exchange that just happens and is never properly explained (I\\'m not sure without spoiling it I can recall seeing a multi-player game where that was a thing, though I must admit I haven\\'t been avid as a gamer in a while), and again the action and actual spectacle is only impressive inasmuch as what\\'s there as Kasdan as competence but not an original or striking vision (perhaps the one perk to Johnston over the next gen director, albeit time and money have changed the quality of effects). But if you are curious in the slightest and the trailer didn\\'t turn you off and like Johnson and Gillan and most of the folks involved in making this, you may be surprised to see people who give a damn about what they\\'re doing and the lines they say and how their characters develop within the limitations of a children\\'s fantasy adventure. It\\'s the B side once you\\'re done this season with Star Wars\\'s A-side record.',\n",
              " \"Suffering from some significantly poor editing and inconsistent pacing this movie ends up being nothing more than a laborious special-effects laden romp. The movies finest moments clearly emerge with Peter Jackson's passion for the film, although the screenplay itself seems to be the main culprit to this deeply flawed movie and something that Jackson himself couldn't pull free from. Despite Jack Black's controversial casting he deftly leads the pack bringing a nuanced complexity to his character and stealing the movie from even Kong himself. Naomi Watts and Adrien Brody give extremely disappointing, if not completely freeze dried anemic performances. This is very unfortunate to see especially from such a capable actor such as Adrian Brody. The two share a chemistry that's reminiscent of the Star Wars prequels - far less painful but equally underwhelming. The slack is picked up somewhat by the minor characters, such as the Venture's grizzled veteran Captain played by Thomas Kretschmann.\",\n",

To many of you, these claims may be outrages but i hope and pray that you will take this into your heart. As many of you may know, The wizard of Oz is the classic tale of a small Kansas girl named Dorthy and her adventures in the magical land of Oz all to find a wizard who can take her home. But when you can look past all of that you can see the storys real, dark, meaning. It may shock you to know that the wicked witch of the west is actually a parody of Christianity, out cast and feared. Glenda, The good witch represents Satan, who may seem nice on the outside, but is actually out to get your soul. And of course, sweet innocent Dorthey is the modern heathen who is pulled away from Christianity by Satan. Also there is the Lion, the Tin man, and the Scare Crow an obvious mockery of the Trinity! But friends, it dose\\'t end there, if you look closely enogh in one scene, You will see some munchkins sacrifice a virgin on an alter! I am appauld that they show this movie in schools to CHILDREN! So I urge you to throw out any Wizard of Oz related items you may have and instead READ THE BIBLE. It is a great book written by the best aurthor ever!\"End of quote.

West\\'s Landon Carter experiences the same character changes as Jamie, yet in different ways.

It is rather slowly paced, with an almost laid back style. The plot is simple but effective and the flow of events quite linear without any loose ends that would in any way challenge the viewer. Murder of a teenage girl in Alaska, LAPD duo despatched to help local police, mistaken shooting and killing of one of the duo by the other, shelf-cover up attempt, emotions of guilt, etc.The acting is good by the protagonists but from my point of view it did not come forth as convincing enough and a touch wooden at times. Perhaps I was anticipating more from the acting talents of Al Pacino and Robin Williams handling a deeper and more elaborate plot than the one on offer here. The movie appeared to have a \"made-for-TV\" feel rather than a cinematic feature. Magnificent Alaskan scenery!',\n",
              " 'The second scene of Napolean Dynamite leaves no doubt in the viewer\\'s mind about the nature of Napolean\\'s character: for fun on the bus ride into school, he ties an action hero to a piece of fishing line and throws it out the window, letting it bump across the dirt road. The action hero bears a passing resemblance to He-Man, the blond, buff protagonist of the popular children\\'s television show of the same name [1]. The figurine takes a beating, and Napolean takes an occasional furtive glance towards the front of the bus to check if anyone has noticed his curious antic. Napolean is literally destroying a symbol of a hero, and the movie allows us to make a swift judgment: Napolean Dynamite is an anti-hero, a role his character fulfills flawlessly as he acts but never reflects on his conduct... or anything else for that matter.Indeed, Napolean is the lead of a cast of misfits who cannot be bothered with moral or philosophical questions. The closest we come is an earnest conversation between Pedro, a Mexican new to Napolean\\'s school, and the school\\'s principal, where the young man is reprimanded for breaking a pi√±ata in the shape of his competitor for the position of student body president. Pedro cannot understand the principal\\'s position --- he has broken several pi√±atas resembling real people in the past for parties. This sort of buffeting-up-against-the-rules does not give Pedro pause. Indeed, we are at a loss to determine if anyone has learned anything by the end of the movie about the burden and trials of adolescence. Napolean\\'s uncle, the burned out ex-football star Rico, plays a poster child for failed dreams whose primary emotional activity is playing back the mental tapes of his high school life. He too never comes to a deeper understanding of his situation --- his wife has to come back to shake him out of his funk.The closing shot (save a bonus wedding scene) frames Napolean and Deb, a young woman who adores him, playing tether ball to the tune \"The Promise.\" The juxtaposition of the love song, which gilds the plaintive striving of a young man in love...I\\'m sorry, but I\\'m just thinking of the right words to say. (I promise) I know they don\\'t sound the way I planned them to be. (I promise) And if I have to walk the world to make you fall for me, I promise you, I promise you I will ... I will... I will... I will......with the scene of a young man whose free time has changed by the addition of girl... leaves us with the chilling conclusion that Napolean will go through the rest of his life blithely ignorant of any reality outside of his head. He is, after all, deprived of the opportunity to take the first step --- deprived of the opportunity to strive for something outside the confines of his provincial existence.But we are treated to a love-song that elevates romantic striving... what gives? Events have arranged themselves for him in a sensible order that satisfies and stimulates him just enough to keep him from challenging his surroundings.[1] Children\\'s cartoons say a lot about the culture in which they reside, and He-Man is a particularly illuminating example. He-Man is in fact borrowed from the character of Superman --- under normal circumstances, <?name> is a mild mannered country boy with no special powers (Clark Kent) and his sidekick is a cowardly tiger. When put in danger, <?name> transforms into He-Man, a super-hero with superior strength and a magical sword, and his sidekick turns into a ferocious fighter with magical armor. Their arch-nemesis, Skeletor, is an evil wizard who has magical powers by default. The cartoon was conceived in the era of Reagan\\'s re-moralization of international politics, and he left no doubt in anyone\\'s mind that the cold war was a war between good and evil. So He-Man was an ideal hero when the times demanded heroes.',\n",

Everyone slags off Bruce Willis, and, granted, he's made a few bad movies (Mercury Rising anyone?), but given the right film Bruce is always a tour de force (Die Hard, Pulp Fiction). And boy, is this the right film. The effects are incredible, the acting superb (Milla Jovovich is a most promising newcomer), the direction flawless. But its the whole enormity of the vision that gets me, a vision of the future Luc Besson (who surely is God himself) dreamed up when he was 15. He has now realised this vision, and brilliantly so. The Fifth Element is very different to Besson's last film masterpiece, Leon, but almost as good in its own weird, futuristic way. This film, for me, has everything; comedy, action, romance, drama and edge-of-the-seat moments aplenty. I know it's not everyone's cup of tea, I know a few people who hated it passionately, but its in my all time top 10 with Star Wars, Leon, The Princess Bride and The Shawshank Redemption, among others.

The movie is supposed to rip on romantic comedies, but quickly becomes the very thing it rips on. It gets quite predictable, and anyone in the audience could have written the ending for it.

              " \"This is a high tension and fast-energy close (as of now) to the Bourne trilogy with Matt Damon. He returns as Jason Bourne once more, still having memory problems and determined to get to the bottom of the issue in what his real identity is and who is responsible for the operations. With the help of London-based reporter Simon Ross (Paddy Considine), who is trying to unveil Operation Blackbriar (an upgrade to Project Treadstone), and former Treadstone support technician Nicky Parsons (Julia Stiles), Bourne gets that much closer to uncover his dark past.The film picks up about six weeks where the events of The Bourne Supremacy left off. Like the previous two films, the movie starts off with a fast pace as Bourne visit's the brother of his girlfriend Marie, leading to Simon Ross trying to uncover the secrets of Operation Blackbriar, as the sinister plans of Blackbriar lead operative Noah Vosen (David Strathairn) to take him and Bourne down unfold. This results in another thrilling and suspenseful cat and mouse chase between the assassins and Bourne, giving the audience an edge-of-your-seat ride that is, what I think, contains some of the best actions scenes in cinema - from Bourne attempting to avoid the Blackbriar assassins to him trying to protect others under their target.Back in the fray is CIA Deputy Director Pamela Landy (Joan Allen), who is against Vosen's mission to terminate Bourne. Her trying to vindicate Bourne adds onto the story's suspense and it makes you wonder where her actions will lead to under the watchful eye of Vosen and his associates.Much intrigue is generated as the secrets of the CIA operation begin to unravel and Jason gaining more steam in unlocking his memory, creating a mind-numbing sense of mystery.The acting is great; Matt Damon continues to deliver as Jason Bourne, quick in action and dramatic, and Joan Allen gave another commanding performance as Pamela Landy, committed to solving the investigation but sympathetic to Jason's dilemma. I also liked Julia Stiles' role as Parson, who has a larger and more significant role in the movie. In addition, all the actors who played the villains were sinister and well-played.Hands down to the film-making team for their stunning work on the visual and special effects, stunts, screenplay, music, sound and direction on this film, as well as the first two. It's probably the most well-balanced, exciting and captivating action trilogy I have ever seen. Highly recommended! Grade A\",\n",

He needed to be more tormented when talking... more dramatic. He fell short as Two Face IMO. Ledgers Joker was perfect. He lost himself in that role.

From the quick-fire clips it seemed like this would be a funny movie with plenty of serious sides with a good-natured sprinkling of sex appeal (i.e women in skimpy lingerie or even perhaps topless).Within the first fifteen to thirty minutes of watching it, I came to realize just how incredibly wrong I was. Now, I can appreciate utilizing sex and drugs to make your point in a movie, such as Scorsese did with Good Fellas and Casino, but what he did with this movie was go light years beyond overboard. I don\\'t think it\\'s any kind of an exaggeration to say that 3/4 of this movie is about absolutely nothing other than doing extremely copious amounts of drugs, acting like a bunch of lunatics from an insane asylum, and having sex with anything that possessed the right biology.

Someone mentioned in an earlier review that this movie was reminiscent of the ancient Roman orgies, but I honestly think the Romans would have far better decorum than this film. All it seemed to do was showcase the absolute worst kind of sociopaths society has to offer without them being psychopathic serial killers. They even come close to doing that when the lead character decides it\\'s a grand idea to snort a half a ziploc bag full of cocaine, put his four-year-old daughter in the front seat of his car, and go screaming out of the garage in reverse before slamming into a brick light post. Let me just say that thankfully the people who made this film did not depict the little girl being injured despite what looks to be an incredibly painful whiplash. If they had, I would have simply shut the movie off and never watched it again, regardless of how it might have ended.Let me just say this movie has no redeeming qualities to it. The sheer volume of quite graphic full-frontal nudity, sex, and drug use would probably be enough to make even the raunchiest frat boy look at his buddy and ask, \"Is this all there is with this thing?\" The fact that this movie received so many accolades, award nominations, and even wins, makes me truly despise how pathetic of a turn our society has made.

Kennedy's assassination, New Orleans DA Jim Garrison (Kevin Costner) tries to prove that a CIA conspiracy was responsible.JFK is flagrantly speculative but inescapably gripping, thanks to director Oliver Stone's muckracking instincts and directorial verve; it certainly entertains more than it convinces, but it's increasingly hard to disentangle what's good about the film from what's just dubious. The popularity of the film led to the passage of The President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992 and the formation of the U.S. Assassination Records Review Board.\",\n",
              " \"It's a darned shame that Love Actually is only just okay, I like it; but the film's title is misleading for the most part. It definitely has likability, which when it comes to Romantic Comedies is somewhat of a miracle. Yet I have no capacity to love it, which the film wants me to, so frequently throughout the runtime that it can be a little unnerving. At certain moments it feels like the director is nudging the audience to chuckle, which when you are aiming for laughs in a film that has a high concept as much as this, is a little odd. The laughs for scenes with particular couples feel forced and unnatural; when I did laugh felt sorry for the film trying to hint that the certain scene or gag is in fact amusing.The film involves about eight couples in the weeks leading up to Christmas at London. It follows their antics and what they do in the countdown to Christmas, whether it is trying to get the Prime Minister's attention or one of the school teachers to like you. The characters themselves range from porn doubles to one guy who has fallen very deeply for his best friend's fianc√©e; so I cannot fault the film for its ambition or scale which is no mean feat upon Richard Curtis's part in particular, him being the director and the writer I am sure that most of the film was under careful consideration. Other parts I feel are not; it is really annoying that the flaws sometimes overlook the positive elements of the film.It is however, an exceedingly charming film that has infrequent laughs which can sometimes make the whole affair seem a bit dull, especially when it comes to the segments that have little humour, charm or even an actual point for that matter. In particular a scene with one of the characters trying to get girls to like him and repeatedly have sex. Fortunately the best moment comes from Bill Nighy as a singer who does not realise how bad his record is. Nighy can always make a film that is middle of the road, much better than it has any right to be and this is the case with Love Actually.Thankfully, the ending is fulfilling, much more so than some of the other elements that just feel there to add to the already unwieldy length. I cannot help but feel disappointed what with the amount of potential it had and most of which is wasted or lost amid all the different sub plots. It can be hard to get your head around a film like this, and it is certainly much more complex than it needed to be.A more appropriate title would be Like Actually. There are key elements that light up the whole affair and others that just crave the attention they feel, but in no way do they actually deserve. With many gaping flaws through the film; some that run fairly deeply, I cannot see why people adore Love Actually as much as they do.\",\n",
              " 'Wrote this elsewhere but I\\'m pasting it here for those interested.It was a disappointment. And not because of any supposed political symbolism, homophobic inclusions, \"video game\" aspirations, racism, and on and on and on... (amazing how we manage to find these items in all sorts of places)... As a stand-alone film, the surroundings and action were stylish and visually arresting, but its characters and contrived drama were mediocre. They never elevated the fight or world to a level beyond technological and artistic flourishes -- although the fervor of Butler\\'s role came close at times. The action sequences try hard to make up for this, but the awe-inspiring force of cinematic battle by itself does not make for a meaningful film. It can make for an entertaining one, though, and that will be this film\\'s chief draw and quality.As an adaptation (and this is where it counts in my mind), it tried vehemently to mirror its source, but only managed to capture the barest essence of Miller\\'s original watercolored Spartans --> In its copycat style (an approach handled much more exquisitely by Sin City, which adapted itself extremely well to the different live-action form), it provides only a *visible* facsimile. It copied over scenes, dialog, gestures, and a degree of Spartan power, but it left the spark of its chief characters behind. There is no hesitation or distraction in the comic Leonidas, no hastened or undercooked back story in the comic Ephialtes, there is no individual or paired scuffle with the comic Spartans but rather an unconquerable mass of human determination, and there is also a sense of raw, wide-eyed terror in the Persian ranks which doesn\\'t appear on screen. What goes beyond this, however, is that it allows itself a \"Meanwhile, back in Sparta...\" subplot which clutters and, for me, diminishes the critical situation in the Hot Gates. Miller took care of business back home very early in the work and afterward pays exclusive attention to the 300 in the narrow pass. He also crafted the entire relationship between Leonidas and his wife in just a few panels with more simple, brute emotion than anything newly created for the film. The comic is Leonidas\\' story only. The film is Leonidas\\' subtle wavering, the Spartan Council, filial relationships in the Spartan ranks, political espionage, and the wife\\'s own home court adventure (which lacked inspiration and ultimately reduced the image of Spartan women rather than improve it). Put it this way: if you\\'re making this film and you *purposely* set out to emulate the comic\\'s look, sequences, emotional heart and intensity as much as possible, would you create from scratch twenty, thirty, or however many interspersed minutes of brand new side story and increase the likelihood of undermining your purpose? Layering an \"orc-ish\" flair to the enemy legions is fine and fitting, but to invent a wholly new story to staple on drama and/or tension is a poor move (and needless, since the quality is already there and waiting to be delivered from the page to the theater). It adds length rather than substance to this film.I came into this as a fan of the comic and of Frank Miller. I actively searched for its good qualities. And many will enjoy its visceral, stylized violence (which is well done), and find humor in the terse quotes and the opulent Persians. The film had incredible potential to convey the artistic and emotional mastery of the comic to the big screen. Ultimately I was left with another flashy blockbuster.',\n",

How this movie got anything over a 4 is mind boggling! People must be judging it on the special effects alone. I disliked this for so many reasons. The story has too many flaws (Bees? There is no vegetation?), the pacing is excruciatingly slow, all the characters are one dimensional, there is almost no meaningful dialogue, the violence is unnecessarily graphic, all the women are depicted as either psychopathic killers or prostitutes (with only one exception, the pitiful \"dreamer\"). Did I even mention the pornigraphic statues? My best guess is this was an homage to a \"Clockwork Orange\".I could have had a more enjoyable experience watching an episode of CSI. It was like they couldn\\'t decide whether to be a sequel or a horror movie. Sequel won, but horror movie would have worked better. There were so many scenes that could have benefited from a jump scare. It was filmed as such, with the creepy music (again the best part), the character standing alone with vast empty spaces behind them, unknown people chasing them. But they just left the character standing there. It was like a bunch of jokes with no punchlines.The holographic girlfriend was annoying and pointless. The \"sex\" scene was annoying and incomplete. It was like watching my IPad buffer. And who didn\\'t see her demise coming a mile away. Yawn.Ryan Gossling gets more unattractive to me with each additional bad movie.

Relevant and funny social commentary on race and contemporary race relations? Check. AN EXTENDED GODFATHER JOKE?!? Super check! Heck even the size differences between the products and appliances the animals use and the way they are integrated together is pretty genius. And ohhhhhh the little details in the animals like the way the wolves cock their heads ti the side when confused is great!! So where does this movie mess up? For one thing it does the common kid movie trope of having irrelevant emotionally manipulative scenes complete with sad music for no reason other than to try to make the audience feel upset. There are some pretty big plot holes, like how did they not hear the wolves howling in the panther scene? How did they cut in front of the entire DMV? Also towards the end the movie seems to give up and just give away all the remaining mysteries as easily as it can in the narratively weakest way possible. But overall this movie is funny, decently animated, and a lot better than your average kids movie. I give it a 7.5 out of 10 and recommend people to definitely check it out.',\n",
              " \"The fifth chapter in the Harry Potter books and film Order of the Phoenix was the weakest of the five films to date for many reasons: the book version was too long and dragged in certain parts, the movie version felt too short and too many gaps that left a lot of unanswered questions. First, I will start off by saying what I didn't like about the film: returning cast members Robbie Coltrane, Maggie Smith, Emma Thompson, David Thewlis, Fiona Shaw, Richard Griffiths, Brendon Glesson, and Julie Walters were completely underused. Other things I didn't like was some of the unanswered question like Percy alienating himself from his parents due to his beliefs of Fudge and the Ministry, Very little between the Harry and Cho relationship even though Daniel Radcliffe and Katie Leung are great kissers. Vernon's resentment of Harry was not shown, Petunia' feelings towards Harry and her sister were not mentioned. Trewlaney 's prediction of the Prophecy was not shown, Ron's qudditch scenes were cut, no mention of Ron and Hermione being prefects in the film. Fred and George's frustration of Hogwarts was not show even though their escape was seen.No mention of Dora Tonks being a shape shifter was ever mentioned or the duel between SIrus and Bellatrix. The best parts of the film were Imelda's Staunton's performance as the wicked Dolores Jane Umbridge and getting the feeling of her office with the pink Lace and curtains and even the cats were well done. Another good thing about the film was Helena Bonaham Carter's performance as the insane Bellatrix Lestrange cousin of Sirus Black even though she was underused. Gary Oldman was given more on screen time after barely being scene in the Goblet of Fire and bonded really well with Daniel Radcliffe. Daniel, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson have really matured as actors and work well together. Matthew Lewis as Neville Longbottom was given an expanded role and has really shined well, turning from a comedic relief character to a brave wizard. The Order of the Phoenix could have been a much longer film with more character development. Definitely a much darker film.\",\n",

This film sees a a non believing boy get on a magic train to go to the north pole and meet Santa Claus. Now a big problem for this film is the lead 'hero boy', the character is just not very interesting at all and you really will not care about him as he screws up throughout the film. The supporting cast is a mixed bag, Tom hanks voices the train conductor and does an awesome job in this role and you feel like he is easily the coolest character in the film. Also the other boy billy's journey is really interesting and you see the character grow over the film and in the end he becomes the character you are rooting for. The girl is a pretty bland character herself and the annoying kid is just way over the top and has absolutely no redeemable qualities to him at all. Overall the story is okay with Billy journey being interesting and the discussion about belief or non belief being solid. But when the audience doesn't care about the main characters story then the story definitely misfired. The script is okay mainly because of the train conductors dialogue but everyone else's kind of falls flat. The style of the film though is fantastic the cgi really works to give this film a darker tone and it is sometimes breath taking seeing the beautiful visuals that this film has. Overall though this is just an average film that you can definitely skip on.\",\n",

I thought it was quite good, but am aware of what was wrong with it.But to call the ending a surprise is way over the top. There are only really 6 characters in it so the choice was either: none of them are dead, some of them are or they all are, so it was no surprise for me, so don't expect the ending to come as that much of a shock.The other criticism which I agreed somewhat with was that it took an awful long time to get to the point & not a lot happened along the way to get there. It was always watchable but at occasional point not exciting and could've done with being 10 minutes less.On the plus side though, the young girl stole the show with a brilliant performance & Eric Sykes chipped in with a good role.Unlike other films like this, I didn't find any major flaws or even minor ones. With the knowledge of the end, the early scenes all still work, as far as I know. The one grey area was the locking the doors. I failed to see the real relevance of it & don't know whether they were being locked really or not. I doubt it, but am not sure.Whilst I found the ending no great surprise I thought it was a good ending & well done. But I would still describe it as 'An Ending' rather than 'The Ending.'

              " \"I am extremely disappointed in this movie. It had so much potential but somehow the movie became utter rubbish around the 1/2 way mark. There is way too much cheesy dialog and moments in this movie. I guess I am one of those that expects some degree of realism when I see movies, especially movies such as these that like to themselves seriously (big name stars, story based on arguably the most imp time period in America, etc). I think only a fraction of the movie is based on actual historical facts. There is way too much 'in your face' bravado and 'patriotism'. I agree with some reviewers that the way the slaves were portrayed was a joke. Given that this is set in the late 1700's and in the South, there seemed to be a lot of 'acceptance' of them. Mel Gibson couldn't decide if he should play this movie seriously or tongue-in-cheek and that indecision comes through quite openly. This says a lot about the director too. I saw another one of Roland Emmerich's movie - Stargate, which I thought was utter trash too. Joely Richardson is intolerable as the 'aunt'/'stepmom-to-be' (go figure!). She showed absolutely 0 emotion throughout the movie. She shares equal honors on that front with Chris Cooper, who somehow keeps disappearing and re-surfacing throughout the movie. Heath Ledger and Tom Wilkinson were quite good in the movie, while Isaacs was below average and very one-dimensional. The one main thing that made me feel disgusted about this movie was the lack of emotion in the main characters when their near and dear ones are murdered by Col.Tavington (Isaac's character) at various times in the movie. The costumes and cinematography were the other redeeming features in this movie. All in all, I feel bad wasting my time on this movie, but maybe there are others who are looking for brainless fun (and think this movie is great) that might enjoy this movie.\",\n",

              " 'John Wayne may have been Rooster Cogburn first, but he is by far outdone by the phenomenal Jeff Bridges in the Coen Brothers remake of the 1969 film. The aforementioned directing duo breathe new life into the classic Western tale of a teenage girl who hires a disgruntled former Marshal to find the man who murdered her father.As Mattie Ross, newcomer (at the time) Hailee Steinfeld brings gumption and raw talent as the feisty teenager. Steinfeld shows a guarded vulnerability alongside her veteran co-stars, but she is not second-fiddle by any means. She holds her own by commanding each scene she is in and steals the show from fellow actors Jeff Bridges and Matt Damon. As Texas Ranger LeBeouf is a barely recognizable Matt Damon, providing his brand of cynicism to the mix. Damon is no stranger to being in a Western (having starred in the less memorable \"All the Pretty Horses\"), but this role allows him to shine at the right times. The dialogue between Damon and Bridges is biting as each man tries to outdo the barb of the other, challenging the other\\'s ability to be top dog,; both injecting humor. Equally crisp are the exchanges between Damon and Hailee Steinfeld as Steinfeld\\'s stubborn Mattie refuses to let LeBeouf treat her like a helpless child; drawing much of LeBeouf\\'s ire and providing him with a controlled foil in comparison to the more outlandish Rooster Cogburn.And rounding out the trio of heroes is a well cast Jeff Bridges as the iconic Rooster Cogburn. Bridges brings the \"true grit\" of the title in his vastly different portrayal of the grizzled gunman. He plays Cogburn as a man initially unconcerned with anything other than his next drink, but when Mattie Ross enters his life he does everything to dissuade the teenager from being involved. When she refuses and they spend so much time together on their journey to find her father\\'s killer, Bridges brings out a reluctant fatherly affection in Cogburn as evident when he helps save Mattie near the film\\'s close.The film is expertly shot by legendary cinematographer Roger Deakins. He utilizes the barren surroundings of the American Southwest in making isolation so prominent. Being surrounded by mainly desert or wooded forest pits the main trio against the elements other than dangerous criminals. The scenery is exquisite as Deakins highlights the landscapes with a keen eye that the setting becomes its own character.Give this Western a hit and you will love it...or just like it.',\n",
              " 'I think that it is interesting how many people have written in their favorable reviews of the film, how much they hated the book! I Should think that that would be no surprise to anyone who loved the book, since the film does no real justice to the heart of the novel! What do I mean? Well, that is both somewhat complicated and simple. But in short the screenplay writers and indeed the director have taken a novel which was about a man who was a poet, a visionary and a shaman, (Who was almost completely out of, and beyond time,) and basically turned him into a two bit prick with pants! And if that wasn\\'t bad enough they have also turned the lead female character into a midlife dissatisfied housewife who needs some action, when in the original she was a real, European woman, found as if by surprise in the UnDead Midwestern state of OHiO-IoWa, simply in awe of a man who faced the world completely on his own terms, and who was quite unwilling to try to \"civilize\" him! I knew, when I saw an interview with Meryl, about the upcoming film, that this adaptation was going to be a total hack job! In the interview she stated that she was given assurances, from Mr. Eastwood, that \"all that wordy, poetic stuff\" that was in the novel, would NOT be on display in the film.That was also when I knew that the woman I fell madly in love with, who made such an amazing character as Sarah Woodrough, in the incredible film \"The French Lieutenant\\'s Woman,\" was not the same as the characters she has played {big surprise.}I would then conclude that Ms. Streep is far more likely to be like the character she plays in films like \"The Devil Wears Prada,\" than any character she played, when she was a younger actress!',\n",
              " \"The dramady genre is defined almost to perfection by this movie. It's not the most gut wrenching comedy you'll see, but it has a few heavy scenes that most comedies don't. I think they did a pretty good job on it because there are a lot of places where they could have slipped up and didn't. Two examples are 1) not trying to give an explanation for why the time lapse happens since that would have created another storyline with a lot of room for error, and 2) keeping it to a PG rating, because it probably have detracted from the overall effect if we had thirty more scenes of Phil doing everything he would never dare do normally. If you took this exact same concept and put it into a modern movie, it wouldn't be as good. We pretty much saw this exemplified by Click, which had a similar feel to Groundhog's Day even though it was kind of the inverse concept.Our protagonist is egotistical and slightly unlikeable weatherman Phil Conners. We get to see nearly every side of his personality as he reacts to his plight of being stuck in one of his least favorite days of the year. Regardless of how any give viewer feels about his personality, almost everyone will be able to sympathize with Phil to an extent at one point or another. Some people might not like it that Phil ends up a nicer guy at the end and does a 180, but I would argue that it's completely plausible. We can approximate that Phil was stuck in Groundhog's Day for at least a year, probably much more. And he had plenty of time to think along with plenty to think about. Besides that we see his progression from irresponsibility, to depression, to self improvement and generosity. So I think his maturing was completely plausible, though not inevitable. We get to know some of the other characters fairly well like Larry the cameraman, Phil's high school classmate Ned Ryerson, the lady who runs the hotel, and obviously Phil's new co-worker and love interest Rita. I read a review that said Rita was portrayed as too perfect, which might be true, but it might also just be that Phil is so insensitive to her that we don't notice her shortcomings. Besides, for all we know she just woke up on the right side of the bed that particular day and was a horrible person the rest of the time.The comedy is mostly comprised of the different ironic situations Phil gets into from repeating the same day and how he reacts to the differently each day. There are a few good one-liners, but there is relatively little verbal comedy for the most part.You might get annoyed with the repetition of the different events, as Phil does, but it's not very annoying considering that they have to repeat some events several times. This reflects pretty well on the screenwriter(s) with the way they gave the audience enough information, but didn't repeat it. The way they executed the progression of Phil trying to win over Rita was well done, along with him learning the piano and the general knowledge that he gains of the Punxatawny (probably spelled that wrong) residents. It doesn't come off as spectacular, but it's notable that there weren't any problems with those scenes.I would recommend this to anyone who likes a good story or plot basis. The acting's fine, and you could argue that Bill Murray has an above par performance. It is properly labeled as a comedy, but there are enough serious dramatic elements that you shouldn't choose it if you're looking for strictly comedy. It's one of very few movies that can be enjoyed by all ages without being completely kid geared, so you can enjoy it equally with your family or on your own. If you don't like Rita's character or the general story after about forty minutes, it's probably not worth your time to finish it out. Overall Rating: 8.2/10.\",\n",

I know it\\'s up to the producer to decide what the money gets spent on and which films get made, but this was a terrible miss by anybody\\'s standards.Finally, I have to mention the CGI and FX, which are uniformly dull. This worked for Abrams in another film when the action took place in space, but the same thing doesn\\'t work for Small-town, USA. The train crash, for example, is excruciatingly long and unrealistic, and the viewer begins to wince after the first five seconds or so because it is just so embarrassing.

A little more on the relationship of the twins would have also been nice, as far as I am concerned they didn't need to be two different characters. Plot: Since the movie was rather realistic its just a little bit disengaging if you take the discovery process of their mothers future to be so conveniently laid out in a progressive manner so at to leave the big shock for the end. This is the main reason I give this movie a 9 and not a 10, I believe some more thought on the timeline elements would have made this movie a true work of art. Directing: Great and crispy camera work with some very good shots. At times the character moves about too fast, such as the orphanage, the scene were she visits the ravaged orphanage is a bit too quick and a little more camera work to help the viewer understand the extent of the war/hate would have been better. random twist comparison: I keep drifting to Old Boy and trying to compare the use of the the same plot twist. I think its more excusable to reveal it in the end of Old boy because the plot causes the twist and the information about the twist is centrally controlled by the villain. Conclusion: Great movie, probably not for the soft of heart though I don't find it particularly graphic but conceptually it can affect some people. Probably a good movie for starting controversial conversation topics afterwards.\",\n",
              " 'Before watching The Butterfly Effect, I wasn\\'t expecting it to be any good. Mostly because of the name Ashton Kutcher being star of the movie. Luckily this exceptional movie made my first assumption seem very wrong. Some movies tried to look on the \"what if (not)\" concept before, but this I personally think is the masterpiece. The number of different stories was very well picked, as well as were the stories themselves. Actors in the movie did very good job, especially Ashton Kutcher who after all proved himself to be the best pick. I can\\'t imagine anyone else acting it better than him. Movie was very intense, I was pulled in the story easy and got out about ten minutes after the credits. Choosing Oasis - Stop Crying Your Heart Out as song in the end of the movie was extraordinary and together with not many words said, it created the effect of me just staring at the screen thinking, what if... If you by some mistake haven\\'t seen this movie, do it, you won\\'t be disappointed. Current rating of 7.7 is some kind of joke, this movie is 10 out of 10.',\n",

The beginning, like in the previous film, has a strong scene because we see when Bill shoots to the Bride and she tell us directly about her revenge's travel and her final objective: Kill Bill.The elements of spaghetti western films present in this movie are: - The desert environment. - The rough and tough characters. - The dirty aesthetic. - The soundtrack for gives more intensity to confrontation scenes: the Bride & Bill, the Bride vs the grave, the Bride vs Elle. In my opinion, these scenes are the best of this film.As a curiosity, Tarantino uses part of the Ennio Morricone's soundtrack from 'The good, the bad and the ugly' in the chapter six, when Bill finds the Bride.The elements of martial arts films present in Kill Bill Vol. 2, especially in chapter 8, are: - The story about the Old China. - The Kung-fu fights. - The hard training for become a great warrior. - The respect to the master and the revenge for his murder.The movie is divided into five parts: - The chapter six (The massacre of Two Pines): The Bride remembers the last essay of her wedding. - The chapter seven (The lonely grave of Paula Schultz): The Bride confronts to Budd but she is buried alive. - The chapter eight (The cruel tutelage of Pai Mei): The Bride remembers her training with Pai Mei. - The chapter nine (Elle and I): Budd dies and, Elle and the Bride fights - The last chapter (Face to face): Beatrix Kiddo goes to Mexico, she faces to Bill and she discovers that her daughter is alive.This second part is really good for this long revenge story, so anyone can feel satisfaction for conclusion of this film.\",\n",

              " 'The reason I am rating this a 1 is to combat the insane 8.2 rating that this terrible movie has.I\\'m a 17 year old girl, and most people would assume someone my age would fall head over heels for a movie like this. I watched expecting to see this amazingly realistic, incomparable, and tragically beautiful love story, which is how TFIOS had been described to me. After spending two hours watching this movie, I\\'m sitting here wondering if I\\'m made of stone considering I did not shed a single tear. But several movies I have watched, and stories I have read, have left me sobbing and attempting to recover for days. I have never read the book, or any of John Green\\'s books for that matter but now I will forever hold the opinion that he is a fully grown man attempting to articulate not only the life of a teenage girl, but the life of someone suffering with a disease. The first few lines of the movie, narrated by Hazel, made me know I was going to hate this movie, since she was describing things that happened in clich√© romance stories (which is exactly what this is), and how this was \"true.\" The idea that this movie was realistic is ridiculous. First of all, a few token one-liners in the movie were clever and well written, but would never come out of a teenager\\'s mouth. As a teenager myself, I can confirm that we are not that profound. I didn\\'t understand the appeal that either of the main characters had in the other, other than the fact they both had cancer. Hazel was boring, and selfish, and self-pitying, and Gus was so pretentious it made me feel sick, and I never believed for a second that he was a virgin. Of course cancer is a terrible thing, as is death itself, but the fact that I didn\\'t care about either of them, and saw them as a caricature of what John Green thinks or wants teenagers with cancer to act like, made me completely indifferent to their predictable demise. The story line with them going to Amsterdam to visit the author of their favorite book was annoying and unnecessary. Although the author was painted as this terrible person, I actually agreed everything that came out of his mouth about Hazel. I\\'m pretty sure the whole point of that scene was to say \"hey, what can we do to make this movie even more depressing? I know, let\\'s take the one thing that the main character cares about and destroy it, in order to make her completely dependent on her love interest.\" There\\'s too many complaints I have about specific eye-roll inducing lines and scenes in this movie to even remember, but the one that angered me more than anything was when they went to the Anne Frank house. First, they tried to compare the horrible death of Anne Frank and her family, which was an outcome of the most horrible thing that has happened in human history, to these teenagers dying with cancer. As soon as they reached the top floor of the house, paying attention only to Hazel struggling to climb the stairs, in my mind I started thinking \"please make them be respectful. I swear, if Gus tries to crack a self-righteous joke I will punch my laptop screen.\" At first, I was pleasantly surprised, because they were quiet and solemn, but then, they begin making out... Only to make it worse, everyone in the room begins clapping. Why? If I was there, I would be furious at their lack of respect. I can only hope this scene wasn\\'t filmed in the actual house. Towards the end I was constantly checking the bar at the bottom of my screen to see how long I had left. I kept thinking, when is this really sad part coming that will make me cry? and when the credits started rolling, I realized it never would. The fact that people are describing this piece of trash as the best movie they have ever seen boggles my mind. I\\'m assuming it\\'s the first movie they have ever seen. If you want to watch a realistic romance movie, you won\\'t find it here. Don\\'t waste your time.',\n",

Many filmmakers last picture are nothing more than a tired picture directed by an old and tired director but Sergio Leone delivered us a masterpiece. Still what else can we say about this man `s career? Only directing seven pictures Sergio Leone was a unique director, who only received respect from moviegoers and fellow actors. But was given unfairness from the Hollywood community, not even receiving an Academy Award nomination, only the Golden Globes were fair and gave him a nomination for this brilliant film. \"Once Upon a Time in America\" is a masterpiece of art work, one which has two versions. The four hour version which is the true masterpiece and a two hour version which is a jigsaw puzzle. The film is about four friends who meet as youngsters and start doing street crime but then an incident occurs when one of the members gets killed and the other gets arrested but once he`s released from jail during his manhood he and his friends perform great deal of organized crime mostly with help of political connections. The characters name is Noodles and is performed by Robert De Niro in what should have been an Oscar nominated performance. I won`t get much into the plot so I won`t ruin the film. Now I won`t say this is the greatest gangster flick ever because it`s not. The Godfather movies beat it by great miles but this is definitely one of the top ten. Sad as it can be it was underrated and still is. How? it`s a mystery to me. Maybe it`s because of the two different versions I think. Probably more people have seen the two hour version.

              " \"I am not bashing the Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 2 because I feel that it is a cynical cash grab, which it is. My issue with it does not necessarily have anything to do with how I feel about the actors. Jennifer Lawrence is a very gifted actor who can take on demanding parts.My problem with the finale of this series is that it fails at the script level. It retains all the flaws of the Hunger Games series and then adds several more, resulting in a form of entertainment with a lot of sound of fury and special effects but very little underlying substance. The Hunger games series should have played itself out like a Marxist dialectic: the young hero Kantniss Everdeen discovering that she is part of an oppressed proletariat, incorporating communist teachings, and then leading a communist revolution to topple the capitalist elites and install a social utopia. This series should have been about the intellectual evolution of Everdeen into a revolutionary leader, determined to reshape the world in accordance with a communist ideology.Yet the first Hunger Games, despite being OK as entertainment, lacked these characteristics. Instead, this first Hunger games played like a re-run of survivor. The second instalment was a step down from that. It regurgitated all of the predictable survivor program material, but then added that scene in the end when Everdeen realizes that the enemy is the capitalist elite. The third instalment was even worse: Katniss is not playing even second fiddle to Plutarch and President Alma Coin. She is just used for propaganda purposes. I don't know about you, but I think Jennifer Lawrence deserves much better than being put into multiple tiresome propaganda reels in order to boost the morale of the troops. After all, haven't women's rights gone a long way since the Second World War when women were sent out into the field to make the lives of male soldiers seem less miserable.Then came the finale, with incorporates all the flaws of the previous programs and adds fresh ones. Once again, the makers of this series denigrate Katniss. Now she is put as head of a small uncover team going deep inside the capital in order to assassinate the villain, President Snow. Big deal! To add salt to her wounds, Katniss is expected to give up power voluntarily first to President Coin (played horribly by Julianne Moore) and then Plutarch (played by Seymour Philip Hoffman) who is really put on screen as a thoughtful elder statesman than anything else. The other major problem of the series is that it is not really about anything, except a group of young people strategizing about how to penetrate the capital and then going through the motions of dodging one special effect after the other. There is really no new material presented here and the worst part of it is that all of the trials and tribulations befalling these heroes are boring and predictable. The palace square is flooded with oil at one point, which would be exciting except we know from medieval history that spilling boiling oil over an army is one of the methods employed to protect a castle. Then come the attack of the ogres -- again not that exciting, because we have seen the same material in previous Hunger game movies and even King Kong for that matter. Admittedly watching Katniss brutally murder President Coin did bring some joy, since it is good to see a terrible actor put out of commission. Yet ultimately, the finale of the Hunger Games is ineptly made, morally and intellectually bankrupt, and uninspired. I suppose it is fitting for the finale to get the lion share of the blame. I have gotten into the habit of assuming that the flaws in the first, second, and third episodes would somehow be resolved in a later episode. Then when the finale comes and fails to address these flaws, the result is a massive disappointment.\",\n",

              " 'There is so much debate about this film from so many corners. Of course, you have the purists out there who are forever loyal to Michael Crawford and Sarah Brightman and are unwilling to accept any other actor in their place. Then you have the stage enthusiasts who refuse to watch any film adaptation of a musical because it is not a \"live\" performance.Quite frankly, I\\'ve seen this story both on Broadway and on film and I can honestly say the experience has been equally extraordinary. At the very least, you have to begin with the exquisite sound of Andrew Lloyd Webber\\'s musical score, which for me remains his most passionate masterpiece to date. I was first introduced to the Phantom as a sophomore in high school when we played selections from the score in band. I immediately became hooked and bought the CD\\'s. From there, I spent the next ten years picturing what this show must have looked like on Broadway. Several years ago, my wife and I finally had the opportunity and it was worth every minute of the wait. Crawford and Brightman were long gone, but the soul of the play was still intact: an extraordinary score coupled with a heart-wrenching love story. I was overwhelmed.Seeing the film was just as overwhelming. The best advice I can give anyone is don\\'t go into this film expecting the Broadway show. You\\'re more than likely to leave disappointed. Rather, enter knowing that there is a phenomenal sound that awaits you with a lavish, eye-popping visual parade that will have you completely enchanted. Though many would have preferred Crawford and Brightman to reprise the roles that made them so beloved by fans, the filmmakers managed to bring some new, raw talent to the front. Put simply, Emmy Rossum was a gift from God. She was the right age for Christine, she could act and absolutely stole your heart whenever she sang. As for the Phantom, I thought Gerard Butler did an admirable job. Albeit, they went for the more younger, \"sexier\" Phantom look, I think it worked for today\\'s film audiences. Both of these talented thespians had very tough shoes to fill. Minnie Driver was absolutely delightful as Carlotta. Patrick Wilson had the dashing good looks for Raul but unfortunately lacked the charisma of a knight in shining armor for Christine. Joel Shumacher was the ideal choice to direct this film, combining a skilled visual style with passionate storytelling. There are so many moving moments in this fable which worked on both mediums and it all comes down to a timeless, tragic love story that continues to haunt us long after we\\'ve left our seats. So if you continue to say, \"well, he wasn\\'t Crawford\" or \"well, it wasn\\'t the show,\" then you\\'re simply denying yourself a wonderful experience. In this day of assembly line film-making where quantity is demanded more than quality, \"Phantom of the Opera\" allows us to slow down and worship the magic that keeps us going to the movies.',\n",

A sign of a great film is when it can do all of those things even though you know the outcome. Unless you've been living in a cave (or a small country mansion in Pakistan) you're probably aware that Osama Bin Laden, the effective 'poster boy' of international terrorism and the al-Qaeda, was found and killed by a group of US Navy SEALs almost two years ago. Zero Dark Thirty documents the hunt over a 10 year period, beginning with a sound collage of phone calls during the 9/11 terrorist attack. This opening pretty much sets you up for the kind of film this is; dark, menacing and uncomfortable. I was a little skeptical going into this film, fairly certain that it would patriotically wave the flag for the USA and shove down our throats how 'great' they are as a nation. However, it's surprising how unpatriotic the movie is. Maya, portrayed astoundingly by Jessica Chastain, is almost a CIA-prodigy who becomes obsessive about the capture of OBL. She starts out as a fresh-faced new recruit in the US Embassy in Pakistan, initially overwhelmed by the brutality of torture, and gradually morphs into a reclusive and obsessive key-player in the manhunt. Chastain is incredible, being both cold and unlikeable while at the same time being human enough for the audience to still invest in her character. It is a remarkable performance matched by the stellar supporting cast. However, this is very much Maya's show, sometimes feeling more like a study of a workaholic than a docu-drama.Conversely, when the big guns come out, they certainly come out. For the majority of its two and a half hour running time, most of the action comes from the offices and workspaces of the US Embassy or the CIA, that is not to say that there aren't isolated scenes of explosive action, but they are certainly secondary to the drama. However, this being a picture about a manhunt, the final 30-40 minutes is some of the most gripping and exciting cinema that I've seen in a while. Again, it's a credit to the filmmakers for taking a story we know well and making it into something that still takes us by surprise. Perhaps the biggest snub of the Academy Awards this year was the lack of a nomination for Kathryn Bigelow, which probably has something to do with the difficult politics and subsequent controversy surrounding the picture. Her nomination would have been one of the most deserving, as the film's power and effect is almost single-handedly down to her direction.

But here\\'s the thing that impressed me: this is THE VERY FIRST MOVIE that Hensleigh has ever directed, and it is held on the shoulders of a complete unknown (unless, like me, you have been steadily watching Thomas Jane\\'s career ever since Boogie Nights). And it seriously holds its own in the face of such STEEP competition. I disagree with the critics (what the hel1 else is new?) on this one: I think that Jane\\'s acting was NOT wooden or sophmoric. I think that it was actually very good, considering the fact that he portrayed emotion and thought with so few spoken lines. In the scene with the Russian, for example, absolutely ZERO dialogue took place, and yet you knew what the guy was thinking (as in \"OH $HIT\"). Other complaints deal with the violence and \"sadism\" of the movie, but, as sick as it sounds, I was RELIEVED: I guess I\\'m just bored with comic book movies like Hulk and Spiderman that are made more for younger teens than for adults, and the rated R grit of this was refreshing for me. But as far as the critics are concerned, I\\'d say this makes strike #2 for this year (preceded most notably by their disgust for box-office phenomenon, THE PASSION), because in spite of all the \"this movie\\'s too dark\" this (the punisher is SUPPOSED to be dark) and \"this movie\\'s for testosterone-fiending idiots\" that (okay, it IS an action movie), the audience that I saw the movie with--a vast array of teenagers, adults, and five elderly women who sat behind me (one of which very-justifiably muttered \"MM-MM-MM\" in one of several luscious moments when Tom Jane makes his way to the door sans t-shirt)--absolutely LOVED it, as can only be assumed by all the shouts, laughter, \"OH\"s and applause. So THERE, Ebert. Further proof that critics CANNOT speak for the people. I recommend it. P.S.: another high point was a sneak peek at Tom Jane\\'s follow-up movie coming out in June, highly-acclaimed Sundance movie, STANDER, which will have wide-release soon while the Punisher is still fresh in people\\'s minds and Jane is more recognized. I, for one, haven\\'t seen it, but according to several people who have, Jane gives an \"Oscar-worthy\" performance as South African cop-turned-thief. So to all the critics who have already said the man can\\'t act because of the Punisher: I\\'d say in a month or two you\\'ll be caught with your foot in your mouth. AND MY RANT IS OVER.',\n",
              " 'I will give my considered take on what Serenity represents .There are certain SF movies that form IMHO a canon. These movies are movies, which CHANGE for good, or for ill how we view movies. Believe it or not, Serenity is part of that Canon. Quite simply if you can decipher the text, Serenity is a Postmodernist SF masterpiece. So, if you are like many people in the SF world who hate Serenity, essentially it is because you do not get the existentialist ANGST, you will be correct that the movie is CLOSED SHOP.Whedon essentially is a game player. He say that he wants to create a REALIST SF environment, all the while understanding that SF realism is an Oxymoron. This movie DELIBERATELY rips off every SF movie that has ever existed and ever WILL exist! But the reason is NOT TO TELL A STORY, but to pull the knowing audience into another REALITY, which at all times is patently UNREAL. I will just give just one snippet of what I mean. When the crew gets to Miranda (Shakespeare anyone?) Whedon changes the entire atmosphere into if it was a Star Trek episode! The point of this bunch of Outlaws acting like Star Trek is to show the weaknesses of Rationalism. Now the plot spoiler that the revers are the end product of an Alliance experiment is DELIBERATELY simplistic to get the audience to see what he is getting at in a direct manner. Then what is absolutely brilliant is that when the crew discovers the secret of Miranda, River suddenly announces, \"I\\'m better\". What is brilliant about this is that one is forced to ask this existential question - what would it mean for River to be better? This point is quite subtle. Remember that the Alliance was trying to \\'cure\\' humanity of its violent tendencies! Spot the existential Mobius Strip anyone?If you think (like me) that this is cool, then you will realise what a Genius Mr. Whedon is, for I have not seen anyone pull off what Mr. Whedon has done with Postmodernist ideas! He completely blows Matrix Reloaded off the map!

I think that they could have put in some more details to make the movie longer, but as far as I'm concerned, all the major plot points got put in there, and nothing was left out that can't be introduced to the story line in later films. Personally, I think that the next film will be longer and better.3. THE ACTING WAS TERRIBLE. THE ONLY GOOD ACTING WAS SAPHIRA. Not that I disliked Saphira, I actually quite enjoyed her character, but I think there is a little more credit to be given to the rest of the cast. Jeremy Irons is a fantastic actor. I was thrilled that he was cast as Brom, because that's exactly how I pictured him. Ed Speelers did a terrific job as the lead, especially for a first-timer. Robert Carlyle was perfect for the part of Durza. In short, I think that the film makers did an excellent job of casting.4. THE MOVIE IS A DISGRACE TO THE BOOK AND TO CHRISTOPHER PAOLINI. Well, I have not spoken to Christopher Paolini on the subject, so I cannot write this comment knowing his views. However, I do know that authors of books sell rights to film companies to make films of their books, and while they might not have control over casting, script-writing, and production, it has to be initially approved by the author. That being said, Christopher Paolini must have thought that the movie was pretty good to approve it. Also, movies are never going to be exactly like the books, so just get over it.In closing, I would just like to say that it's just pure entertainment, nothing more. The film was made for no other purpose than to entertain an audience for two hours and for people's enjoyment. Stop over-analysing it.I might also add that I saw the film in a full cinema and nobody got up and left early or booed the film. At the end, the audience stood up and applauded. I was clapping right along with them.\",\n",
              " \"A very compelling and often visceral experience by Soderbergh well worth praising both on attempt and execution.The crucial lines of the film were in the beginning and at the very end:''We're here to listen'' which was said to the counsellor in the drug relief program to ease her daughter's woes by Michael Douglas who recently has been instated as States' new drug control officer yet turned down this offer at the very last point for his own reasons, ironically for his daughter's involvement in drugs.And said by magnificent Benicio 'Javier Rodriguez Rodriguez' Toro to his cop-partner while waiting for a bust on an anonymous tip in the arid,humid and sepia-toned desert near Tijuana-Mexico,his town:''in my dream...may she rest in peace,(my mother) had a plastic bag on his face and could not breathe...''When you walk out of the theater, the excuses and the frequently sensible(relative perception though),explanations of the convicts,victims and the characters and their acts echo in your ear.You ponder over them yet it's very difficult to state an exact right.There's only one thing for sure:Both the trafficking and the struggle to stop this act will continue as long as the only mighty power of mankind prevails;which is money...9/10 overall with very strong appearances from the cast and the supporting actors,the film,for me,felt like 30 mins instead of 147 mins with some very chilling background music at times and awesome cinematography especially when depicting Mexico.I highly recommend this piece of art to all concerned...\",\n",
              " 'See my full review here: ericsgoodstuff.blogspot.com/2013/03/film-howls-moving-castle.htmlHayao Miyazaki\\'s groundbreaking animated films, like Princess Mononoke and Spirited Away, can be described as sweeping, fantastical, and heart- wrenchingly joyful. Equally epic, Miyazaki\\'s 2004 film Howl\\'s Moving Castle, adapted from Diana Wynne Jones\\' book of the same name, renders the viewer immobilized through the experience of a young girl on a journey of discovery. The film reaffirmed Miyazaki\\'s role as the global ambassador of Japanese animation. He is a visionary man who understands that discovering an alternative side of life can be a revitalizing experience, and in that sense sends his audience right along with his characters.The film begins in a world at war. Young Sophie works in a hat shop and bumps into Howl, a known wizard and local heartthrob She quickly falls into a world of magic and finds trouble when the Witch of the Waste binds her with a spell of old age. In her newly geriatric state she goes in search of Howl. His house, a walking, magic fortress serves as his headquarters and main point of departure for his war-related missions. Now known as Grandma Sophie, she enlists herself as his maid and finds a place among the other house mates. Howl, a tenacious wizard full of defiance and destructive power, is caught in his own difficulties. Dealing with pacifism in wartime, he has become a political casualty of the raging conflict. The struggles crescendo and combine - as they are often wont to do - and the characters face difficult, life-changing choices. The whole things comes together in classic Miyazaki style.Is this starting to sound a little too \"magical\" for you? Maybe you think its just for kids? Well grow up and accept that some children\\'s movies are even better for adults. This film was released on the tailwind of Miyazaki\\'s most globally recognized film, Spirited Away, which had just become the first anime film to win the Academy Award for Best Animation. The two films, along with most of his movies, communicate many of the same themes. Howl, which set box office records in its own right, was highly influenced both by the previous success of Spirited Away - still the highest grossing Japanese film of all time - and by Miyazaki\\'s own reactions to the beginning of the Iraq War. He has been classified as a pacifist, feminist, and traditionalist - all perspectives that inform his characters and their struggles. But the moralistic view of his stories is more universal than partisan. In this film Howl\\'s struggles are treated more as personal than political.While there are lessons to be learned from Howl\\'s demons, Sophie\\'s character growth is equally poignant as she decides to optimistically accepts the challenge of old age. Her quick transformation from young adult to elderly is one most youth would not accept lightly, and Miyazaki helps the viewer to reflect on age and identity as he explores how Sophie deals with instant maturity and physical limitation. She finds she\\'s able to gradually shed the years by embracing life and its challenges rather than complaining about them. Love, energy, and wisdom come as she is forced to accept things she cannot change and address those she can. Life in Howl\\'s mystical mobile home is lived a few steps away from normality. Time and space have no constancy. The resulting mobility, while exciting, has kept Howl and his house mates from facing reality. Sophie breathes some fresh air into the place as she takes responsibility and learns to value the moment and the relationships that surround her. I prefer watching in Japanese with English subtitles. When coupled with the beautiful, melancholy score it completes the cultural journey and give you a truly foreign experience. If you just can\\'t handle reading while watching, or you are enjoying it with kids, turn on the translation. John Lasseter - Miyazaki\\'s championing super fan in the US - and his team at Disney went to significant lengths to make a quality English translation including recording voice-over work by critically acclaimed actors.This film is a gem during which I always sit in constant amazement. The beguiling blend of music, love, magic, and visuals creates an orchestral experience. Just as Miyazaki\\'s character\\'s rarely finish a film in the same form they began it, you\\'ll be closer to internalizing the fact that life is always changing. And maybe you\\'ll see the young person inside the next old face you see.',\n",
              " '**Warning! Mild Spoilers Ahead!**There are a handful of issues I have with this movie. I thought the cross-cutting between stories was disjointing due to the vastly different paces of each tale. I noticed a few blatant blue screen shots. Some of the dialogue seemed out of place, almost hokey. And on top of all of that, the film suffered from being the middle one in a trilogy, a film that by definition did not contain a true start or finish.Having said all of that, I still choose it as my best film of 2002 for this reason. After I saw \"Chicago,\" I sneaked across the theater hall to catch the last half hour of \"Two Towers\" again. Not even close. I thoroughly enjoyed \"Chicago\" (#2 or #3 of 2002), but \"Two Towers\" was simply on another level. It completely swept me away into Middle Earth as I relished the final battle for Helm\\'s Deep. Gandalf and company streaking down the hill into the enemy was one of the best movie moments of the year. The emotion seemed quite real, and even the slight melodrama didn\\'t bother me at all.\\nOther highlights...the opening sequence of Gandalf and the Balrog was excellent, yanking the audience back into the story as though they never left. All the battle scenes were not only epic, but cohesive. Some directors just don\\'t seem to know how to put a fluid and continuous battle together (see \"Gladiator\"). But these (Helm\\'s Deep primarily) were fantastic, ranking among the best ever on film.Bottom line: The best movies pull you into their world, make you feel their emotions, and relate to their characters. \"Two Towers\" did all that and more, which is quite remarkable given the adventurous and fantastical nature of the film.',\n",
              " \"Movie felt a bit too nihilistic and depressing to watch. Still, it wasn't the worst movie. I'll give that to 1997's Alien Resurrection. Alien 3 was a very hard movie to get through, as it didn't had the same scares of the first horror movie, Ridley Scott's 1979's Alien or the adventure thrill of the sequel 'Aliens' directed by James Cameron. Directed by David Fincher, the movie continues after the events of the sequel. Aliens left off on a hopeful note of no more bad dreams until Alien 3 came along and injected its own nightmare. Everything that people love about Aliens was rip away from the opening shots of Alien 3 when the escape pod from the Colonial Marine spaceship Sulaco crash-lands on a prison-run refinery planet, killing everyone aboard except Lieutenant Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver). By doing this, Alien 3 takes away every character, Cameron help established about the series and cause a sour-taste for the fans of Aliens, in the first few minutes, by killing off three beloved side-characters in the first three minutes. Certain fans, in particular, regarded the decision to kill off the characters as a slap in the face. I thought the director did show some courage by killing off the characters from the second movie, but the way, they die wasn't going make the fans happy to have their heroes die so brutality, without any attempt of establishing them in the third movie. Unknown to the prison population, an Alien organism was also aboard the escape pod, which then begins a killing spree on the planet as Ripley must once again is forced to stop it. Alien 3 had a difficult production, with various screenwriters and directors getting involved in the project, with multiply ideas. Some of these ideas for the third movie were pretty outlandish, ranging from aliens infecting technology, aliens coming back to Earth, Ripley going to the mother planet of the aliens, and others. The production start filming before a screenplay was even finish. The director had to re-shoot and rewrite the script simultaneously while fitting in sets that had already been built, so filming was already plagued. It didn't help when incessant creative interference from studio executives also came into play. Fincher has since disowned the film, citing the aforementioned reasons. I have to give David Fincher, some praise for even getting this movie out there. Since this movie, David Fincher has gone to bigger and better success. Just to note, the film has two versions of the film. One is the Assembly Cut, which was released in 2003 and the other is the original version from 1992. There is a few different, between the two, as Assembly Cut tends to be the better version as it establish more of the themes of Alien 3 and gives more screen time for the prison characters. One of the biggest different between the two, was the animal that the alien morph from. People tend to complain when living animals, especially dogs are killed, so in the assembly cut, the movie has the alien come from already dead, Ox. In my opinion, it doesn't make much sense. The alien in the movie tend to be fast, and move like a predator because of the traits it got from its host. An ox wouldn't have these types of traits. A lot of people complain how fake the CGI alien looks like, but it's not CGI, at all. It was a scale puppet operated by sticks on a blue screen. It was so poorly lighted and rot scoped that looks like cheap early CGI. Another complain about the movie is the lack of action. After watching an action full sequel, this movie seems dull as the prisoners lack guns or proper guards. Most of the prisoners are pretty unlikeable and unsympathetic as they were just brutal ex-criminals who found religion. There is misandry's tone of the movie. The movie is filled with male characters who exhibit only the worst male characteristics. None of the great male virtues are nowhere to be shown. It didn't help that the prisoners were all bald, and talk with a cockney accent. None of them really stand out. Even Ripley seems completely out of character. Two movies, two subtle love interests, no sexual relationship and then in this one she meets a dude for five minutes and wants to get down. So awful. The movie seem to have some weird sexual metaphor. A lot of theorist think the movie is really about AIDS, with aliens representing AIDS. Other thinks it is about religionists dogma as one of the early story draft had Ripley come across a religious planet that has rejected technology. I like how the film was trying to get back to the horror concept of the first movie, but I miss the suspense and claustrophobic feeling. The movie ruin the suspense, by showing us that there was alien from the beginning of the film, but they try to add a surprise to Ripley's character, but it doesn't make any sense since there was only one alien. Without spoiling it, too much, there was no way that Ripley could had impregnated. It just not logically. Even the Christ-figure ending was a bit hokey. I can do without all the religionists overtones as it was already too dogma depressing for me. Overall: the pacing is slow, the editing is very choppy, the visuals are murky, and the story is weak. One early draft of the script focused almost entirely the Aliens characters returning home would serve better than this film, only to find out a rival faction of planet has use the Aliens as a bio-weapon to conquer Earth would be better. While, the latter was used somewhat in Aliens: Colonial Marines video game. I still, haven't saw a good version of that plot. I would pay to see that movie.\",\n",

              " \"Doctor Strange is a superhero film based on the Marvel Comic Book of the same name. Although I wouldn't consider it a Top 10 film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, I still found it to be a highly enjoyable origin story. Along with Guardians of the Galaxy, this film wasn't afraid to take risks or stray too far from the typical Marvel superhero formula.Stephen Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch), a brilliant but arrogant neurosurgeon, is involved in a car accident that seriously damages the nerve endings in his hands. With his career now ruined, Strange sets out for Nepal, where he heard a paraplegic learned how to walk again. While in Nepal, Strange meets the Ancient One (Tilda Swinton), a mysterious person who runs a society of loyal followers tasked with defending the Earth from evil inter-dimensional threats. Intrigued by the possibility of unlocking his full potential, Strange undergoes a lengthy training process with the Ancient One to become a master sorcerer.Perhaps the most thought-provoking of the Marvel films, Doctor Strange is a surreal but interesting look into the psyche of the title character. Benedict Cumberbatch feels like he's giving it his all in the lead role and even his American accent wasn't too bad, although it is far from perfect. Mads Mikkelsen also gave a solid performance as the film's villain Kaecilius, who didn't just seem like a generic bad guy wanting to take over the world. However, Tilda Swinton steals the show as the Ancient One, Her spiritual lectures in the film really struck a chord with me. The visual effects were fantastic, strongly reminiscent of Inception and 2001: A Space Odyssey. So far, I'd say it's the most visually gorgeous looking film of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. I look forward to seeing the Doctor Strange character in the future Avengers film.I rate it 8/10. Like with just about every Marvel film, be sure to stay after the credits for two bonus scenes.\",\n",

              " \"Putting aside all the hype surrounding this movie, I like it but not as much as the first because of the following reasons: 1. Why was Adrien Brody growling his dialogues throughout the movie.2. Topher Grace with negative shades.. ahem.. he's also the comic relief by the way.. doesn't do much damage though does he..3. Movie was quite predictable in some places.. The thrills and chills never came.4. Some of the scenes could have been developed further into good action scenes but most of them had tame endings. For example, we never got to see what happened to Danny Trejo's character. One moment he's shooting down the weird dog creatures, the next moment he's appealing for help as part of a trap set by the predators for the remaining members of the group.5. The black guy gets killed next (no surprises there I guess).6. The part where the Russian guy gets one of the predators (won't tell you how) has already been done in so many movies before.7. Laurence Fishburne got wasted.. literally.8. Predictably the hero comes back for the girl.9. Initially, the movie takes too long to develop.Now the good parts..1. The casting was good, especially that of Adrien Brody considering he doesn't look the macho type. If only he hadn't growled so much to look macho.2. The setting (the hunting ground) - another planet.. interesting.. will make for a good sequel, if there are any.3. The introduction of two types of predators..4. They stuck to the original background score.5. They did not reinvent the wheel. I also like the fact that they acknowledged the prequel.. most sequels don't bother acknowledging the fact that there have been precedents..6. No time was wasted on histrionics.. just that the movie takes a little long initially to develop; after that though it is relatively fast paced.Treat this movie as the build up to the sequel. I am hoping that the sequel will explore new grounds.. maybe better tactics against the Predators.. bigger meaner predators.. a more sinister plot.. better character development.. The sequel ought to be pretty damn good. They've got a good thing going..Here's to the sequel..\",\n",
              " 'We\\'re far along enough now that we don\\'t need to be told what happened to Bruce Wayne\\'s parents to understand his motivation to become Batman. I mean other films don\\'t need to detail the area surrounding Santa\\'s home at the North Pole to set the scene of his home, his wife and the elves.So, when this film cut to the funeral procession toward the Wayne family crypt I thought \"Oh good, no unnecessary details, and at 151 minutes, there must be a lot of story to be told\". Then it all went flat due partly to TWO run-throughs of that tragic night in a boys\\' life.Also, I\\'m one of those people who feel if you\\'re going to show favoritism to (in this case) liberal media outlets, then you should be instructed to include a representative range of media outlets or, none at all.

This film has all the signs of the \\'concept-by-committee\\' method of film making because it comes off as a series of vignettes stitched together by people working in separate cities. A lot of time was spent on dreams, flashbacks, Amy Adams just standing there - poised to deliver her lines, a hallucination, Henry Cavill moping about his reputation, Ben Affleck exercising, and hardly any time on Wonder Woman. Where there should have been story-telling, we got filler. When they told a story, it was so very brief.

First of all, it was missing Frakes who didn\\'t return to the director\\'s seat as he should have. Secondly, it didn\\'t have that witty banter and dialogue that spiced up Insurrection. There were many scenes lacking that \"trek\" humor we have grown so fond of, as well as many missed opportunities to add closure or finality to a scene. For example, after Riker kills the Reman Viceroy, he doesn\\'t conclude the scene with something like, \"don\\'t worry, hell is dark.\" Moreover, the cameos were pointless. I would have liked to have seen more with Guinan\\'s character, as well as learned about Wesley Crusher\\'s sudden return after being whisked away by the traveler in Star Trek: TNG. The space battles were great! I thought the special effects were awesome. However, you couldn\\'t really relate with the bad guy \"Shinzon\" because of the lack of character development there. Finally, Data\\'s \"sacrifice\" was too predictable. It didn\\'t grab me like Spock\\'s death in Star Trek II: The Wrath of Kahn. Overall, I was disappointed with this movie, and I\\'m hoping that the writers redeem themselves by somehow making another, better film.',\n",

The Bide finally got what she wanted. Kill Bill Vol. 1 and Vol. 2 are a few of my favorite movies and I loved them so much i bought them on DVD.

One of her hits includes Bill, the man she has been wanting to kill since the beginning. Uma Thurman, again, deserved her golden globe nomination as The Bride.

              " 'The Disaster Artist I saw The Room a few years back and love it, to the point of obsession. No doubt, its absolutely terrible with a ton of flaws in production, acting, and script. Yet there is something endearing about it, that makes it ridiculously entertaining. I own the damn Bluray because I love it so much. Definitely my favorite \"so bad its good film.\" When I heard about The Disaster Artist I was so infatuated with an adaptation of Greg Sestero\\'s book. I loved all the trailers and was anticipating this for a while. Safe to say, The Disaster Artist is actually really good. Very entertaining, funny, and well acted.The film is an autobiographical take, focusing on the beginning of the friendship of Greg and Tommy Wiseau. Wiseau is definitely a mysterious figure and the two soon become friends because of their love for acting. Down out of luck in Hollywood, Wiseau decides to make his own film (with a mysterious fund for the film) and while the film production wasn\\'t without turmoil, the end product turns out to be one of the worst films of all time. And yet, the film becomes a cult hit and a success despite being terrible.I think Franco\\'s filmography is streaky to not very good (although admittedly I\\'ve only seen stuff here and there) but this most be his best work. Franco captures most of the embodiment of Tommy Wiseau and is so magnetic with his awkward mannerisms, ideas that don\\'t make any sense, and his foreign accent. The film is very funny, you will get the humor and enjoy yourself even if you haven\\'t seen The Room. However if you\\'ve seen it you will really appreciate what goes on in this film.The film has a few cameo appearances which are cool, stay tuned even after the credits. The film also boasts an incredibly catchy late 90\\' early 2000\\'s soundtrack and the attention to detail of the recreation of scenes and sets of The Room is almost perfect. This film actually made me want to re-watch The Room and re-experience the wonders of unintended genius of Tommy Wiseau. Franco has done a wonderful job with this film, and even though its about the worst movie ever, the film about the making of it is rather fantastic.8/10',\n",
              " '\"The Princess and The Frog\" is a classic tale of \"The Frog Prince\" with a fresh and new twist. We begin our journey with waitress Tiana, played by Anika Noni Rose, in hard pursuit of turning her daddy\\'s dream of owning a restaurant into a reality. When she finally thinks she has the restaurant, she loses it again due to lack of finance. Meanwhile, Prince Naveen of Maldonia (Bruno Campos), in search of financial stability as well, gets bamboozled by the Shadow Man, played by Keith David, and turned into a frog. Naveen sees Tiana at a Masquerade Ball, mistakes her for a princess and convinces her to kiss him to turn him back human; he also promises to compensate her. The plan backfires and they both end up being frogs. Soon the two set out together in search of Mama Odie, a blind voodoo priestess who serves as the film\\'s Fairy Godmother (Jenifer Lewis), to turn the pair into humans again; but she actually shows the pair what really need. \"The Princess and The Frog\" shows that while we may know what we want, we will never truly enjoy it unless we have what we need: Love. It begins in the scene where Tiana is home with her mother Eudora and father James. Her parents are about to put young Tiana to bed when her father holds on to Eudora\\'s hand and tells Tiana to promise him that she will never lose sight of what is really important. The directors used proximity and the body language of the character to emphasize the point that they were trying to get across. James and Eudora are very close in this shot; there is also use of body language and eye contact to show that the couple is in love and value and set one another as priority in life. Throughout the movie, the directors continue to use proximity and the body language of the characters to show how Tiana and Prince Naveen develop, become closer and realize the how important love is. There are plenty of other Disney movies that share the same thematic ideas as \"The Princess and The Frog\". These movies such as Pocahontas show that we cannot reach our full potential or truly enjoy the full extent of life without embracing love. The directors of Pocahontas use the Dream motif throughout the film to help Pocahontas realize her heart\\'s true desires. There was also Grandmother Willow, the film\\'s fairy Godmother, to help Pocahontas understand what her dreams mean. With the help of eye-catching animations, enticing tunes and an unforgettable troupe of characters, Disney turns this traditional story into a modern-day classic.',\n",
              " \"Visually stunning I will admit. Irrfan Khan is fantastic in his part. These are the only highlights as the story is in my opinion overrated and very boring. I could not help that the film's overall message was that if you are not a person of faith in a higher being then you are bad person . I dislike people with attitudes like this. Whether or not you have faith in a particular religion or a higher power a person should not be judged by this characteristic which is what this film does. This is how I have interpreted this film and for all I know that may not be the overall message of the film but that is the way that it comes across to me. With that aside I could not help but find many similarities with Tim Burton's magnificent film Big Fish. This film (and I am assuming the novel that it is based on) feels like one big rip off of Big Fish. I like Ang Lee's films but this is by far his worst and in my opinion stole the Oscar nomination for best director from Ben Affleck (who definitely should have won). Do yourself a favour and watch Big Fish, it's a much better film.\",\n",
              " 'I see comments where the people writing goes back to the book, whining that \"this should be there and this should not and that is completely off and nothing\\'s good\"...people that clearly cannot see a movie for what it is and a book for what it is.No movie goes entirely true to the book, NO movie. We have examples of that ever since movies based on books and even legends started being made.If you cannot accept that this movie is the work of those behind it, with a base story (the writer gave her permission), then do not watch it.If however you can appreciate a beautiful story, a beautifully made movie with breathtaking scenes, scenes that makes you wanna sink into a hole and cry as well as scenes of pure joy, then watch it. I have read the book, I have watched the movie...just as with Lord of the Rings, I can appreciate one work, AND the other.To those not liking the CGI and therefore discarding it...why? Do you not paint pictures in your head when reading a story? What is wrong with making Susies world beautiful in a way it couldn\\'t possibly be otherwise? How can you for example watch the last scene with the victims coming out of the light and only go \"Oh my goodness, I hate CGI!\"....? No, this is a beautiful movie, it is made differently in many aspects from the book but I can tell you right now, the book is still here. All can read it and love it..I for one, am glad they didn\\'t put everything into the movie. It didn\\'t need to be there, not for me who has read the book, not for those I know that hadn\\'t read the book before they watched the movie.Watch it with an open mind and open eyes, watch it for what it is. A beautiful, sad and at the same time happy story of it\\'s own.',\n",
              " \"I really don't understand what people are complaining about! Scifi movies are meant to offer Oscar winning performances but instead are meant to offer the viewer a fun couple of hours of escapism which Skyline delivers! I won't go into the story as others have already done that but what i will say is that firstly the concept itself is brilliant...An alien race who uses a bright light to do its nastiness. This is brilliant because no matter what species you are, human, animal and very probably other alien races - you will always want to look at a bright light! The SFX here are truly fantastic and keep you on the edge of your seat all the way through! The ending is also great because i was wondering what the point was of giving Jarrod the powers they did yet do nothing with it but then they showed exactly what they had planned in the end.Both my partner and myself can't wait for the second one to see Jarrod take them down in his new 'guise'! Go to see the movie with an open mind and with the attitude of just wanting to see a fun SFX ridden alien movie and i guarantee you wont be disappointed. If on the other hand you go in expecting to see an Oscar winning story with Oscar winning performances then you WILL be disappointed! Its a lot of fun and im sure thats all its intended to be!!!\",\n",
              " 'Pocahontas is a charming story about two young people who fall in love despite the fact that the groups they belong to want to kill each other; much like Shakespeare\\'s Romeo and Juliet. This one is a classic Disney movie that captures the audience\\'s attention with unrealistically beautiful people, great music, and great animation that is characteristic of Disney. However, I don\\'t think the climax lives up to the tensions in the rest of the plot. Also, after that there are no real negotiations between the Englishmen and the Native Americans about how they will coexist in Virginia. Finally, the whole movie is very historically inaccurate and should not be showed to a history class for educational purposes. The climax is the scene where both sides are ready to fight each other and the chief is about to smash John Smith\\'s head in with a rock. This scene is over within a couple minutes and the movie is over soon after that. The entire movie leads up to the climax, like in any movie, but the scene itself is somewhat disappointing. Pocahontas throws herself on top of John Smith and just like that her father has a change of heart and so do the colonists. There is no internal conflict shown for anyone except Pocahontas about the killing of John Smith, and because of that the climax is lacking. In addition, there are no real negotiations between the Englishmen and the Native Americans after the war is avoided about how they will coexist in Virginia. After the war is avoided, Ratcliffe, the governor, attempts to assassinate the chief and because John Smith throws himself in front of the bullet, the potential repercussions are ignored and everyone suddenly gets along. This is entirely unrealistic because, as everyone knows, getting two different groups of people to get along can be very, very difficult. Also, for the entire movie each respective group tells their people that the other is terrible and out to get them. The colonists are told that the Native Americans are \"savages\" and to shoot them on sight. Alternatively, the Native Americans are told that the white people are violent and barbaric and call on other tribes to help them in the seemingly inevitable war. This kind of negative sentiment is not just given up in a matter of five minutes. It should have taken them much longer to work out their differences. This film should not be showed to a history class as it is very historically inaccurate and therefore cannot really teach students anything about the way life was when the English arrived in Jamestown, Virginia. In the movie, the character who falls in love with Pocahontas is John Smith. However, the person who really married Pocahontas was John Rolfe. John Smith did initiate friendly relations with the Native Americans, but it was John Rolfe that brought Pocahontas to England where she died of dysentery a few years after she gave birth to their son. Also, while it is not actually known when exactly Pocahontas was born, it is said that she was born around 1595. Assuming this is true, in 1607, when the English arrived at Jamestown, she would have been 12 years old. In the movie she was portrayed to be much older than this and falls in love with 26 year old, John Smith who was more than twice her age. Finally, in the movie, Ratcliffe is depicted as this rich, gold-hungry leader who wants to kill all of the \"savages\" and forbids John Smith from going to talk with the Native Americans to promote peace. Ratcliffe orders his men to shoot any Native American on sight and, as a result, sparks the beginnings of a war with them. He also refuses to accept the fact that the Native Americans have agreed to put down their weapons and live in peace with the Englishmen and in an attempt to shoot the chief of their tribe, accidentally shoots John Smith. Most of this is historically inaccurate. While it is true that many of the colonists didn\\'t like him, Governor Ratcliffe actually asked John Smith to begin friendly relations with the Native Americans when he was in office and encouraged him to establish trading between them. These three are among the many inaccuracies in this movie that make it uninformative.In conclusion, although I enjoyed the movie very much, it is historically inaccurate and therefore can\\'t really teach anything about history. Pocahontas is a nice story with a great soundtrack, however, the climax doesn\\'t encompass the entire plot efficiently, there are no peace negotiations, and important aspects of the movie are historically inaccurate.',\n",
              " 'When I was a little kid, about 6 when this movie was released, I ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT! especially the tumbling plane fuselage action.and it\\'s totally brilliant, going with a new carnivore instead of with the same old T-rex, the fight scene between the Spinosaurus and T-Rex was like \"Move over Rex, you\\'ve had enough screen time!\" it is very symbolic on how the (JPIII\\'s) director & Writers managed to introduce a new Anti- Hero well, So I give them two thumbs up. Also, it\\'s short compared to the first two, since you have a small set of characters, I also wanna comment on the Pteradon action, in which makes them the tertiary Anti- hero.(The Velociraptors are the secondary)but one really odd thing on the Spinosaurus, why does he/she keep stalking the group? I mean, The Velociraptors have their reason because of their eggs, but why you chase them Spino?overall, i highly recommend this movie, it does not deserve it\\'s 300 million box office, it deserves more!',\n",
              " \"Like most anyone who has watched this movie over the last fifty years or so, I was introduced to it by a great number of people proclaiming it to be the greatest movie of all time. So at the age of fourteen, I got it from the library, popped it in, and had my understanding of film changed forever.I do not consider this the greatest movie of all time. But it is the most important movie of all time. It is arguable that film should be divided into two eras: the pre-Citizen Kane era and the post-Citizen Kane era. There are enough revolutionary techniques and ideas to make a film lover's head spin. But one thing a lot of people overlook is just how good this movie is on its own right.The best way I can describe it is a film version of an acclaimed twenty-century novel. There is sharp symbolism, highly developed characters, a somber mood, and nuanced discussions about broken dreams and the human condition.If you're a fan of those types of stories, you will enjoy Citizen Kane. If you're not, you may not, but do yourself a favor and watch it anyway. Just like every literate adult should have already read The Great Gatsby and Of Mice and Men, every filmwatching should have already seen this movie. If you have not, I suggest you take care of that.Me? I adore The Great Gatsby, like Of Mice and Men, and will watch this film over and over again. It concerns a reporter trying to track down the meaning of the last word of the famous media Tycoon Charles Foster Kane. Along the way, he talks to various people who knew Kane and gets many different sides of the story. He ends up not finding out the meaning of that last word, but we, the viewers, do.Now, I'm not gonna spoil what Rosebud is- this despite the fact that it has basically become shorthand for 'spoiled twist'- but I will say that it fits with the themes of the movie quite nicely. This is the right way to do a twist. One thing many directors and screenwriters forget is that twists are not merely supposed to be shocking; they are supposed to add to the story in a fundamental way. Most good stories I've seen get this. All bad stories I've heard do not. It is a fundamental and simple concept, so I have to wonder how so many directors and screenwriters miss it.Speaking of directors and screenwriters, for this film, they are one in the same. Mr. Orson Welles fills both roles and acts in the titular role, pulling off the most astounding triple play in movie history. Any triple play is incredible in this industry, but doing it in one of the greatest films of all time: that's impressive.There is a scene midway through the film where Kane walks through a hall of mirrors. It stuck in my mind, and it sticks in the minds of almost everyone who watches this movie. I cannot think of a better example of the power of visual storytelling. An amateur filmmaker would have just had Kane ramble off his emotions. But Welles, taking advantage of his medium, crafted one of the most haunting and memorable scenes in cinematic history. If you have a friend who won't shut up about how books are better than movies, show them this film and point out this scene.One thing that surprises many inexperienced filmwatchers is how this film only won one Oscar. Yes, a film said by many to be the greatest of all time only received the Oscar for Best Original Screenplay. Best Director? How Green Was My Valley. Best Cinematography? How Green Was My Valley. Best Art Direction? How Green Was My Valley. Best Picture? How Green Was My Valley.Now, How Green Was My Valley is not a bad film. I suggest you watch it if you have nothing better to do. But it's no Citizen Kane. I doubt many of you have heard of it.Oddly enough, this was not simply a case of poor decision making, though you could find much of that if you look in the annals of past Oscars. Media mogul William Randolph Hearst believed this film to be about him in all but name (very arguable) and said it was a negative portrayal (eh) that misrepresented him (definitely not). He could not get all copies of the movie destroyed or anything like that, but he did fight it at every turn, and he is likely the main reason why the film did not get more Oscars.Ironically enough, William Randolph Hearst's name is one that has somewhat been eroded by the passage of time. The only thing many people in my generation know about him is that he likely inspired this movie. So it turns out that the film he fought against ended up giving him a form of immortality.Kane is one of the most complicated characters in all of film, and more importantly, all his complexities mean something. Nothing feels like it's there just to make the character more complex. The result is a brilliantly textured story, one that can be loved even by people who aren't typically into this type of arc.This film does not only feel revolutionary, it feels alive. In fact, I'd go so far as to say it is the first film to feel truly, cinematically alive. There were great films made before it; among them are Gone With the Wind and The Wizard of Oz and King Kong. But those films were merely sweeping, brilliant stories put on film. This is a unique, cinematic experience.\",\n",
              " \"Edgar Wright. Everything he touches turns to fried gold. Right?When your CV includes cult comedy classic Spaced, the genre-defying Cornetto Trilogy and the inimitable\\xa0Scott Pilgrim vs The World,\\xa0anything short of amazing feels like a disappointment.\\xa0This is the feeling of anticipation that accompanies Baby Driver, the director's first feature since his fall out from Ant Man and the MCU.With a tagline claiming 'all you need is one killer track', audiences have been clamoring to get their eyes and ears around the heist thriller since the first trailers landed. And from the off, it's full throttle.The first twenty five minutes is unadulterated Wrighteousness\\x99: The Jon Spencer Blues Explosion's 'Bellbottoms' sets the tone as the getaway begins: song lyrics become dialogue; gunfire acts as percussion and tyre screeches and fender benders become part of the musical landscape. Think Shaun of The Dead's rhythmical barman beating to Queen's 'Don't stop Me Now' or where Spaced's Tyres (Michael Smiley) holds an A1 clubbing jam fair to the sounds of a pedestrian crossing. Similarly,\\xa0Baby Driver doesn't miss a beat.Steve McQueen once obsessed about breaking the 'film barrier': that distance between the lens and the road that sucks the speed out of racing scenes. Wright smashes right through that barrier. On-set tales of Wright strapping himself to car bonnets whilst the cast were thrown around the interior creates scenes that stick two fingers up to\\xa0The Fast and Furious\\xa0franchise and would make the King of Cool ask you to pump the brakes.Wright's stylistic flare isn't just restricted to the action, either. As the titular Baby, Ansel Elgort's coffee run goes all 'Singin' in the Rain' as he swings 'round lamp posts whilst lyrics to the accompanying 'Harlem shuffle' pop up on screen via fly posters, shop windows and road signs. It's all kinds of clever.The trouble is, it all gets a little bit tired, and\\xa0this is where Baby Driver stalls. Once the initial heist is done, the second act seems to lull as the effect wears off whilst we wait for that one last job. Like a friend who keeps playing you songs that are each 'the best ever', your attention starts to wander and the film feels flabby and overly long as a result.The cast doesn't help either. Yes, Baby (Ansel Elgort) is effortlessly cool and omni-Ray Ban'ed with a playlist for every occasion, but his relationship with Debora (Lily James) falls flat. James is endearing but ultimately underwritten and there's never a sense that her and Baby are really a thing. Let alone a thing that's worth fighting for. For that, see Jon Hamm and Eiza Gonzalez's Buddy and Darling. Hashtag relationship goals. Spacey is as Spacey does, but it's down to Baby's father figure Joe (CJ Jones) to hold the heart of the film in his hand, never more so than on the steps of the retirement home.My former MCM John Bernthal is initially set up to be the antagonist that the film deserves, but then the first job's done and like that, pfft...he's gone! Jamie Foxx steps in, and while he's the kind of villain you want to see get got, I'd have rather Bernthal's Griff been there for the long haul, especially as it would have allowed for a satisfying bait and switch when Buddy finally steps out of the shadows. With that being said, we do get the best Flea from Red Hot Chili Peppers cameo since\\xa0Back to the Future so, swings and roundabouts.Thankfully, the third act hits its stride again. Once plenty of posturing and a ham-fisted meeting with an arms dealer called The Butcher are out of the way, we're back down to business. The climax is nothing complex and is all the more efficacious as a result: high stakes are on the line between compelling characters with a personal issue at the heart. It's as high-octane as the start of the film suggested and it will make you think twice about parking in an NCP ever again. And after all that, it ends not with a bang but with a whimper, as over-explanation hampers the ending.Now more than ever,\\xa0Shaun of the Dead and Spaced feel like old friends: the ones who you've known since college, but you can no longer really remember how you actually met. Then along came Hot Fuzz.\\xa0Funny, for sure, but not best mate material. Now? We're BFFs. I'm hoping I can say the same about Baby Driver one day. But for today, I'm not mad, I'm just disappointed.\",\n",
              " \"Well, I went to the video store last night to return a movie, and I just happened to have some certificates to get free movies. I had one in mind and got it, and being a bit of a Tom Hanks fan, I happened across this one, and debated on whether or not to get it. Finally, I grabbed it before I changed my mind, and I am so glad I did! I wasn't quite sure what to expect at first, so I sat down to watch this only knowing who was in it and that it was about two lawyers and deals with AIDS. However, by the first fifteen minutes or so of the film, I knew it was going to be a good one. The story is such a powerful one that it shook me, and still has me a bit shaken. The acting in here was brilliant on all sides, and the story is something we can all learn from - everyone is equal. I knew that Tom Hanks had won an Oscar for his role, and after watching this I can totally understand why - one of his best performances I have ever seen.To summarize - brilliant. Brilliant film, brilliant actors, brilliant story, brilliant lesson. Simply brilliant. If you haven't seen it, you certainly should!\",\n",
              " 'Overall Fight Club is a good movie and is certainly worth watching but I\\'m not buying into all the \"best film ever\" bullcrap. Hearing that is really annoying to me in fact and part of the reason why I\\'m writing this right now. Let me start off by saying, I get the film. I\\'m sick of hearing people tell me that I don\\'t get the movie. That really annoys me. The movie is what it is and I\\'m pretty sure most of the retards that spend all their time of Fight Club message boards saying \"I am Jack\\'s (insert retarded something or other here)\" are looking too much into the film. Fincher is pretty good as the film\\'s director, but the direction gets annoying to me after a while because I just keep feeling that he\\'s pretty sure he\\'s a bad@ss which isn\\'t true. Se7en\\'s good, definitely better than Fight Club and mostly it\\'s because of how Fincher keeps his style at a minimum whereas in Fight Club he goes crazy, this too annoys me. Edward Norton and Brad Pitt are good in their roles, Norton has been better though (Primal Fear) and Brad Pitt is not the person I want to learn a life lesson from but he\\'s alright and he makes me laugh every now and then so he\\'s OK. I do however have certain problems what this movie is trying to preach which people then take seriously and follow, mostly that it\\'s anti-corporations and stuff but the film itself has countless actual logo\\'s for major corporations within it. You think that Fincher was just being clever by putting those in the film? I don\\'t, he\\'s a sell out just like the people they\\'re fighting against in the film. Also, while they\\'re on the bus looking at the underwear ad and Brad Pitt says, \"Self-improvement is masturbation.\" I almost cracked up, he couldn\\'t say anything more absurd considering how he himself looks. Anyway, these are just a few of my gripes but whatever. It\\'s a pretty good movie just don\\'t buy into all these morons and their view of Fincher as Jesus\\' Second Coming and Fight Club as perfect, that\\'s just dumb and it annoys me.',\n",
              " 'For a while, I thought I was seeing a Roland Emmerich film. In fact, I could have sworn it was a Roland Emmerich film due to all that cataclysmic-disaster and wanton destruction featured in the film. For those of you who don\\'t Roland Emmerich-he is that director who helmed commonplace summer natural catastrophic films like (Independence Day) and (The Day after Tomorrow)-sacrificing story and plot for sheer entertainment. However, San Andreas is directed by Brad Peyton and his utilization of sequences suggests that he is either trying to mimic Roland Emmerich or trying to outdo him.I couldn\\'t agree more when a film writer from screenrant.com said-in his/her own words: \"Hollywood has been kind to Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson. True! I couldn\\'t agree more. He is one of the most successful wrestlers turn actor. He is that sure guy who you go to when you need a little bit of muscle and badass attitude in action figure. And as a result over half of his Filmography is in the action genre: (Fast and Furious Franchise), (Hercules) (Faster) etcetera. However, apart from the usual comfort-zone-acting, his character is laden by worry-with appropriate reason for that worry.Here he plays Raymond Gaines: a Los Angeles Fire Department Air rescue going through a divorce. Raymond divorce stems from the fact that he feels responsible for one of his daughter\\'s death. After Blake (Raymond\\'s surviving child) travels with Daniel: Emma\\'s boyfriend (Raymond\\'s wife) to San Francisco, an earthquake strikes obliterating the city. Raymond attempts to rescue Blake despite the continued destruction of the city-hoping that he doesn\\'t lose another child.Despite the concerned nature of The Rock\\'s character, there is little exposition for the character\\'s mood. Dwayne Johnson though is able to pull off that season fire department rescuer with ease and seasoned experience. Here, he sort of lays back and allow the events of the film to take centre stage. Though there are still the usual displays of heroics here and there especially in that beginning scene, which looked like if the earthquake has started from there. But those courageous attitudes and behaviours are used to match the urgency of the situation rather than downright showing off of strength as we have come to see in some of his films (Looking at you Hercules). Don\\'t get me wrong, The Rock is one of the stand- outs entertainers of our time: the type you will call a \"Movie Star\" and not a \"Movie Actor\". It has become a norm for most films to please its audience than educate on the revolving occurrences. San Andreas falls into that category. Scenes explaining what an earthquake is are usually done through fast-talking tectonic-plates seismic, blab-blab gibberish. I finished the film and yet am still not able to offer a simple definition of what an earthquake is. I should be able to do that considering that I\\'ve just finished seeing a film featuring falling skyscrapers and landscapes that seem to meander like a liquid flow. In the supporting characters, no one shines because expectedly women are still made to become the supportive figure (Carla Gugino\\'s character). And the only female figure (Alexandra Daddario) that does something still looks as hot as ever after surviving earth- changing seismic events. And lest I forget, let me get this of my mind. Firstly, what\\'s up with the similar make-up given to Carla Gugino and Alexandra: black hair/black hair, same shades of eye pencil in a too glaring attempt to make them look like mother/daughter? Secondly, what was the importance of Ioan Gruffuld role to the film? The film could have turned out well without his character, maybe save cost of production from the viewpoint of cast\\'s wages. For Christ\\'s sake, he was in the whole film without any importance to the plot screaming at each quake, surviving each with luck. And then when you think he might survive this ordeal, he is taken off the film in a much familiar death scene. That death scene is even more stupefied because of the helpless look on his face. It is not just an insult to the actor\\'s talent but to the actor himself.Nevertheless, all praises to the film\\'s special effects, catastrophe and on-screen San-Francisco\\'s obliteration. Watching as the earthquake levels the whole city is entertaining and as such the audience feels less pity for the extras who scream around. Brad Peyton captures the wanton tragedy very well with believability from the quakes leveling down the skyscrapers down to the tsunami storm engulfing the city. There are several sequences which stood out. Particularly, I liked that scene where The Rock tries to beat a tsunami wave by speeding over it with a speed boat and when he seem successful a cargo ship follows with its containers spilling out- almost crushing the main characters. I also liked how the director scattered debris over the waters which had swallowed the city. And that sequence, that particular sequence where a cruise liner is washed on-land by the tsunami waves is commendable. The massive scale destruction makes for an interesting watch and the consequences of that are shown if only a little, especially that time where we see individuals stealing from an electronics store.Truth is that, San Andreas is the perfect blockbuster entertainment (destruction and all) that goes out of its way to please its audience so much that emphasis is removed from its casualties and placed on the survivors, but it could do away with certain elements and incorporate some-plot wise. Rating: 2 ¬Ω stars out of 4.',\n",
              " 'I have had break ups. We all have. What is depicted here is an attempt to somehow glorify what for most can be a trying time in their lives, with a comedic twist.This movie fails on so many levels because the two characters meet, at all places, a Cubs game for starters.

She, on the other hand, puts up with his garbage long enough that after they buy an expensive, hip condo, she then decides she wants out.The films then tries, miserably, to put a comedic twist on a relationship that had no merit and had no business lasting as long as it did. They are both too weak emotionally yet the film tries to present them to the viewer as regular, stable people. It\\'s true that many regular people have had break-ups that may slightly resemble this one, but does the film have to be so insulting as to suggest that breaking up with someone you\\'re supposed to love be so degrading?

              " 'Only 8 out of 10 because the author/screenwriter made too many assumptions about the audience. With over 900 reviews posted I don\\'t know if anyone has touched on my point or not. So here goes. Many of the references will only be caught by sci-fi fans over the age of 30 who also paid strict attention while in high school or college. That\\'s not a jab at anyone\\'s intelligence. There are simply not many people who find quantum theory exciting. The movie attempts to give a visualization to this not-so-well understood school of thought. Combining fiction along with real science is not easy to do while keeping it entertaining at the same time. An example reference is with the oversized USB flash drive shown at the end. Did anyone else notice it was \"full of stars\"? Not glitter...stars. Yep, that\\'s a 2001/2010 A Space Odyssey monolith reference. The shape of the drive along with the stars was a dead giveaway. Whenever a monolith appears in 2001 it is always followed by a major evolutionary jump. What was Lucy experiencing? An evolution of consciousness. What was Lucy seeing during her armchair travel through time? If you also said \"evolution\" then you are correct. She saw the evolution of life on earth as well as the evolution of time and the entire universe itself. Lucy went a step further than 2001/10 in that it shows the interconnections with ALL things at the quantum level and beyond. This is just one of the references in the movie that kept me entertained throughout. The main problem with these kinds of references is that they usually don\\'t translate very well when shown on the screen. Deeper explanations also tend to bore the heck out of an audience so they wind up on the cutting room floor. Again, it\\'s not an audience intelligence issue. It\\'s an audience familiarity issue. Assuming that the audience is as excited and as deeply interested in the same heavy topics as is the writer will usually make for bad ratings and a \"meh\" movie.',\n",

              " 'C- For quite some time I struggled with the rating I wanted to give this film. Was it extraordinary? Or was it terrible? After recently buying the DVD and seeing it again, I\\'ve come to the final verdict. From my perspective, it had the potential to be the next \"Blade Runner\"; whether you view it as a rip-off or just having striking similarities is up to you. Either way, the end result was a vivid script watered down to fit the summer blockbuster typical dismal flick. Will Smith is an exceptional actor, as well all know. But here his performance was like watching two different actors. I would say more than half the time Smith delivers clich√©, predictable comedic dialogue. For example, \"Oh, hell no!!\" He then spends 30% of the movie giving us a deeper, more emotionally driven performance. The mix dilutes his character to the point Del Spooner is just another \\'rouge cop\\' with a gun character, which we have seen a thousand times courtesy of Steven Segal and Shaft. Bridget Moynahan plays her role so dryly I really didn\\'t end up caring for her character at all. Shia LaBeouf\\'s presence wasn\\'t necessary at all, basically just pointless. The best actors in the film were undoubtedly James Cromwell and Alan Tudyk, both who gave the film the intensity and mystery that keeps it weakly on its feet.One other thing I have to pick apart is the atmosphere doesn\\'t feel all that futuristic. Only a few shots reminded me this took place in the future at all. One reason I rate it up in itself is because Marco Beltrami does the score, and so I was elated to hear it. He\\'s never disappointed be it \"Blade 2\" or \"Hellboy\".

              " '\"The Dark Knight\" is a quintessential American masterpiece. It is the new American Gothic. For those that are unfamiliar with this name, \"American Gothic\" is the famous 1930s painting by Grant Wood symbolizing America at the time with a bald farmer holding a pitch fork with a stern wife in front of an American Gothic farm house. Mr. Nolan\\'s \"The Dark Knight\" is just as impressive a symbolic work, because it holds a mirror up to the darkness and hatred in people and the world, which is more complex than some real life leaders would like to pretend.In one sense, comic books have always echoed parts of American culture and gave voice to issues that plague society under the guise of fictional characters in replicas of American cities fighting evil. Mr. Nolan\\'s \"The Dark Knight\" takes the comic book guise and transforms it into a tragic and dramatic shroud. Through Mr. Nolan\\'s lens, the characters in \"The Dark Knight\" are placed into impossible ethical dilemmas by a psychopath who delights in creating anarchy, and is literally sadistic and masochistic.Method and madness have rarely been personified on film better than Heath Ledger\\'s performance as the Joker. When the Joker burns a pyramid of money (his cut of mob funds), Mr. Nolan is demonstrating that the Joker cares not for possessions or riches as a means of self-appraising his success in life. The Joker measures the success of his life by the extent that he can twist the world on its head -- how often he can make good people do bad things, or his masterpiece, taking a heroic crusader for justice, and twist him into a nightmarish murderous psychopath.Mr. Nolan\\'s screenplay could not have been in better hands than Sir Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, Gary Oldman, Christian Bale and Heath Ledger, who launch into their sculpted lines and characters with such grace and measured ferocity that there is no doubt that these men are 5 of the greatest actors of their age. Of course, one of whom, Mr. Ledger, I would have been delighted to know him better through a lifetime in film, but must suffice with the indelible memories of Ennis Del Mar and the Joker.Tragic, complex, fearless and mesmerizing are the only words I could utter after seeing Mr. Nolan\\'s masterpiece. Mr. Nolan\\'s film comments on the human condition as good as, or better, than any film that has ever won the \"Best Picture\" Oscar from the Academy of Motion Pictures and Sciences. The Dark Knight\\'s story is timeless and elegant with breathtaking visuals, and paced perfectly in dialogue and destruction.Bravo!',\n",
              " 'I must say I was impressed with a movie I\\'d originally considered boycotting. Before I\\'d seen it, I had three problems with the movie: 1) The advertising looked so much like Scary Movie\\'s that it felt like a ripoff (a ripoff of a parody, that\\'s interesting); 2) I\\'m a hardcore \"teen movie\" fan and was too sensitive to the criticism; and 3) The trailers didn\\'t look all that funny. I relented, though, partially because I really wanted to see a movie or two this weekend and partially because I realized that if I loved both Scary Movie and Scream, why can\\'t I love Not Another Teen Movie (of course I did go into Scary Movie with anticipation because I wanted the other \"scary movies\" to be parodied to death, but still). Also I heard about the gratuitous amount of nudity in the film, and that clinched it (I\\'m sounding more and more like a cliche\\'d teen movie fan by the minute).Anyway, it was a very funny movie throughout (I coulda gone without the toilet scene, but other than that) and really seemed to be made by people who were actually fans of the genre as weird as that sounds. And not just the recent teen movies, but dating all the way back to Ferris Bueller\\'s Day Off, Risky Business, Fast Times at Ridgemont High, Grease and the John Hughes Brat Pack movies. There was a scary level of attention to detail with little things like the names of buildings (the students go to John Hughes High and eat in the Anthony Michael Dinining Hall) to the constant use of music from the movies (off the top of my head, I\\'m thinking about the frequent use of Don\\'t You (Forget About Me) from the Breakfast Club and the cover of Somebody\\'s Baby from Fast Times at Ridgemont High (I started laughing my ass off as soon as I heard that one coming on)). There was also quite a few people from those teen movies on hand, whether in obscure roles (Ferris Bueller\\'s dad shows up briefly as a dad and the teacher who ran the detention (and lead villain) in the Breakfast Club reprised his role for that scene, \"Bogey Lowenstein\" from 10 Things I hate about You played the \"Slow Clap\" guy) to more important roles like \"Billy Bob\" from Varsity Blues playing the same character only stupider as \"Reggie Ray\" or Molly Ringwald (teen queen of each and every John Huges film from Sixteen Candles to Breakfast Club to Pretty in Pink) showing up in a pivotal role at the end of the movie. Oh, and I should mention, the movie was funny as hell. Really funny parodies and some unique little twists (who would\\'ve expected Mr. T to show up in a movie parodying teen flicks (as an aside, though, I don\\'t know if \"Rudy\", is really a teen flick). Very funny movie.',\n",

I assumed it was a typical superhero flick, and boy was I wrong.The story is about a retired superhero (Bob Parr/Mr. Incredible) who is always trying to relive his former glory. But to his avail he is stuck at a wishy washy job living in the suberbs. But everything changes after he is contacted by the mysterious Mirage who, by offering him a chance to be the superhero once more, takes him to an island to defeat a killer robot. His wife (Helen Parr/Elasticgirl) starts becoming suspecious and attempts to locate her husband which causes him to be captured. Realizing her husband is in great danger she leaves her two kids (Violet and 'Dash') home to go save him. The story then continues onward as the kids sneak aboard. I'm not going to say anymore about the story so I don't give it away. But this is a truly great movie, not just because of the main story line, but also because of the underlying story. The story of how a family is starting to fall apart, but grows stronger through helping each other. The movie is also pretty dark and mature, some scenes were a big step from Pixar. And while some scenes were humorous, the movie was actually much more of a drama that you know weren't made for the tykes. Another thing that sets this film apart from other movie is the detailed animation. You can tell that Pixar poured their hearts and soul in making this movie, it is simply a great looking movie. The settings feel and act like the mid-60's while some elements have a not-to-distant feel to it.All in all this will be a smash hit in theaters and will definitely be on my top buy list for my DVD collection.5 stars outta 5\",\n",

Although the Volgons could've been a little let puppet-like. Marvin, the Manic-depressive robot, was dead on character, and his few lines were definitely memorable.

It is by far better than the first Avengers movie and it is better than all the other marvel movies in my personal opinion (I watched AOU last night).

All the characters were for the most part fantastic. Hulk vs Iron Man was a highlight scene.The only down points are Ultron was not as cool as I was hoping and Quicksilver's accent felt off (probably because I have heard him in his British accent and fake American accent too many times) however, Elizabeth Olsen's was good. The Black Widow and Hulk together stuff felt a bit off.Just in case you were wondering I have seen probably all of the trailers and TV spots etc and it does not ruin the movie at all because there is still loads of unseen stuff etc.I am looking forward to the extended edition hopefully it is 3 hours or more because I love this movie.

              " 'Charlie Chaplin is truly a character. On the screen, as well as off the screen, for nearly a century, Charlie Chaplin held a position of esteem within the domain of cinema that can never be topped. Those who have read the autobiography that this film is based on will go into the film knowing that Charlie Chaplin was as iconic on-screen as he was vulnerable in print. His autobiography is a very honest account. Unlike many biopics, \"Chaplin\" doesn\\'t take the cheap route of portraying an unflawed and idealized version of the iconic actor. The film confronts his shortcomings that the actor was courageous to admit. Chaplin, was at various times, a serial womanizer who engaged in more than one \"age inappropriate\" relationship throughout the course of his life. Like many any Hollywood and the film industry, Chaplin often abused his power in the industry to take advantage of star struck women. This self-destructive tendency to get into troublesome relationships plagues Chaplin throughout his entire adult life. But from all of these imperfections, emerges an individual who was a deeply troubled artist struggling to come to terms with both his art and the global nature of his fame. Although the movie seems inadequate at times, overall, the 1992 film \"Chaplin\" starring Robert Downey Jr. is a humanistic portrayal that is just as beautiful as the person it portrays. \"Chaplin\" follows Charlie Chaplin\\'s life from his humble origins in England all the way to fame and fortune in Hollywood. Although Chaplin was born and worked as an actor in England, his pursuit of an acting career eventually takes him to Montana in the United States where he inadvertently begins a film career that would turn him into a global icon. The film does use some rags to riches clich√©s. When Chaplin was first in England, he had trouble getting into restaurants because of his affiliation with theater which was looked down upon by high society. Years later, when he returned to England after spending years making films, the crowd that came to see him was so large that he needed a police escort just to get off of his train. Yet, it is that very recognizable identity and fame that made it difficult for the young Chaplin to call anywhere other than Hollywood home. Charlie Chaplin was not afraid to step into politics and make his voice heard. As an artist, such genuine passion is truly commendable. But this characteristic often made Chaplin a target. Fortunately, \"Chaplin\" doesn\\'t shy away from portraying this part of Charlie Chaplin\\'s distinguished life. Although Chaplin had adopted the United States as his home, during the tense time of the Cold War, Chaplin ended up being targeted for his beliefs. After years of undue suspicion and malicious court cases, Chaplin was kicked out of the country in 1952 as a tragic victim of McCarthyism. The film makes it a point to convey that Chaplin\\'s film career was inextricably tied to the man\\'s political and social views. In fact, at a time when filmmakers were questioning the role of cinema as a form of social commentary, Chaplin was a pioneer in making silent films that spoke volumes about the contemporary society of the time.But the greatest point in Chaplin\\'s esteemed career came at the worst point for humanity itself. While the world was tearing itself apart fighting a second world war, Chaplin stood up, made a risky film about Adolph Hitler himself, and told the world, \"Do not despair. The misery that is now upon us is but the passing of greed \\x96 the bitterness of men who fear the way of human progress. The hate of men will pass, and dictators die, and the power they took from the people will return to the people. And so long as men die, liberty will never perish\". The real Charlie Chaplin was not just an actor. He was the voice of a generation. To his credit, Robert Downey Junior does justice to what is truly a very difficult role.A tear might actually roll down your cheek by the time you get to the end of this movie. In the final scene, Chaplin, weakened by old age and a full life, confronts the timelessness of the art form he created. People will always remember him as a version of himself that even he no longer remembers. A tear rolls down Chaplin\\'s cheek on screen. Chaplin\\'s career was a culmination of being a talented actor, at the right place, at the right time. Charlie Chaplin may have died in 1977, but the global reach and timelessness of Chaplin\\'s work endures. \"Chaplin\" the film is a touching homage to a truly remarkable individual. At the end of his life, Chaplin told everyone that time was his greatest enemy. But there is much reason to disagree with this assertion. Time is the medium through which films work their magic. Chaplin manipulated time in his pictures to capture a perspective of the human experience that can touch audiences a century later with equal effectiveness. Time is his greatest friend.',\n",

I am happy to say that for the first time in a long time, I very nearly left the comfort of my perch as this movie shocked and delighted with an entourage of darkness, gore and screaming woman. A must see movie for any fan of the horror world but if your partner is squeamish, be ready for some heavy cuddling and the odd buried face. If you still have the opportunity to get out to this one at the cinema then do so. If not, a dark room and an excellent sound system is required for the full effect.',\n",
              " 'Is it possible to call Ronin the modern French Connection? Not the story, of course. But the look, the feel, the atmosphere, the action, it all comes back to Friedkin\\'s superb thriller. Instead of a pair of street-savvy narcotics cops, you get a mishmash of characters, ranging from an ex-CIA operative to the Russian mafia. And all of it surrounds on simple question: what\\'s in the case?John Frankenheimer, a legendary director, did not miss a step, not when he had the help of David Mamet, er\\x85Richard Weisz. (Oops! The cat\\'s out of the bag now.) Blending Mamet\\'s penchant for multi-faceted stories and Frankenheimer\\'s style of action-thriller directing, what ends up is Ronin, a tense and gritty action movie that leaves you begging for more literally. The story centers around the formation of a team of mercenaries, who are tasked by a mysterious Irish woman to steal a \"case.\" Among these vagabonds is Sam, played to perfection by Robert De Niro, an ex-CIA agent who is never off of his game. Sam quickly befriends Vincent, a well-connected Frenchman who sees a bit of himself in Sam. But the group is not without it\\'s rabble. Enter Gregor, a cold and calculating ex-KGB operative, whose personal ambitions only slightly outweigh his brutality. As much as Ronin acts like a typical \"underworld\" kind of movie, it is so much more. Above anything else, it is a character film. De Niro and Jean Reno give excellent performances, but they are only accentuated by the supporting cast, which includes Stellan Skarsgaard, Natasha McElhone, Sean Bean, and Jonathan Pryce. As the search for this \"case\" intensifies, you come to see the true nature of each character develop, up until the climactic ending that sheds a light on the true heroes and villains.But what would this movie be without the action? The atmosphere is gritty, but it so perfectly fits the setting in France. To compliment the mood is some very tense action. The bullets fly freely, but the gun fighting is fairly reserved. There aren\\'t a lot of explosions of the extravagant kind. The action is very realistic. But what gives it a real boost is the car chases. Remember The French Connection? Friedkin set a new standard with the car chase in The French Connection. But Frankenheimer has fashioned his own masterpiece, with two distinct and exciting chases.I have heard quite a few complaints about this film, most notably regarding the case. But another common question is why the movie is called Ronin, save for a short discussion about the Japanese story. Yet if you think about it, it is a fitting title. This is a movie about men who are lost, the relics of the Cold War striving to continue the life they once lived. And when an opportunity arises, they will take what they can get, even if it means destroying themselves. Ronin has been one of my top three favorite movies since it first came out. It is an entertaining movie, with plenty to offer. And if it isn\\'t your kind of flick, understand that the story is not one for the modern audience. It intentionally leaves many questions unanswered. But that is what makes it so unique. It is like a throwback to the great crime dramas of the 70\\'s. If you don\\'t get it, don\\'t worry about it. Just accept it and move on.That is lesson number three.',\n",
              " \"Insomnia does not mark the first time director Christopher Nolan uproots a highly original concept and brings it to life on screen, nor does it mark his last. With the astonishing success with the innovative neo-noir thriller 'Memento' the previous year, it was easy to see Nolan had a solid career ahead of him. He's a man who's makes decent acquaintance with originality, from powerful story lines, to absorbing characters, to enthralling thrills for audience to feed on. This psychological thriller starring acclaimed actor Al Pacino, Hilary Swank, Martin Donovan, and Robin Williams in a role unlike any of the charismatic characters he's swallowed in his career; showcases a true and fascinating demonstration of what Nolan is capable of, even if it's quality leads less memorable than his other efforts. The film enters the 'Scarface' veteran Al Pacino as Los Angeles homicide detective Will Dormer who's assigned on a case with his partner Hap Eckhart (played by Martin Donovan) to investigate the murder of 17-year old girl Kay Connell in a small town in Northern Alaska where the daylight sustains uninterrupted for two months. The continuous daylight interferes with Dormer's ability to sleep, leading his insomnia that soon pays a toll his mental state during the investigation. When his attempted apprehension of the killer (played by Robin Williams) goes wrong, it pins Alaskan detective Ellie Burr (played by Hilary Swank) on a separate homicide investigation while Dormer struggles to catch the criminal as he must fight against the psychological deterioration.This psychological thriller isn't your average catch-the-villain story, Christopher Nolan presents the story with gripping psychological elements associated with suspenseful resonance. The story doesn't dwell on typical crime component like shootouts and tense car chases, instead it showcases a brooding psychological character study as it ventures through the main character's struggle in capturing the antagonist from his mental degradation including the symptoms such as hallucinations and impaired physical functions associated with his disorder. This illness plays a key role in the plot, and the film doesn't go out without a fair plethora of thrills. Christopher Nolan drives the plot through a stylish execution that awards viewers with plenty of tight-on suspense and awe-inspiring thrills from start to finish. Very rarely is there a predictable moment. If there is anything that comes more surprising than the twists and turns sprinkled throughout the 119 minutes, it is the confound performance by Robin Williams as the manipulative (yet somehow likable) primary antagonist. Though Al Pacino serves as the pinnacle of the story, Williams comes to the biggest surprise as playing a character on the opposite side of the moral compass, far from the good guy roles many are used to seeing the fine actor in. He makes great memorability for a character with a sinister and complex agenda. Al Pacino and Oscar- winner Hilary Swank are both solidly appreciable in their roles. Nothing surprising but certainly nothing to ignore.Insomnia is an inspiring and captivating psychological thriller with ingenious performance, engrossing thrills, and a smartly executed plot formulated by the efforts of director Chrisother Nolan. The film is more than just a reminder of why Christopher Nolan is such an influential filmmaker he is today, it is a thriller with both inventiveness and smarts that defined a true cinematic arks of it's genre.\",\n",
              " \"This is the director's best film ever - forget 'National Treasure' which was an absolute joke with no heart. Cool Runnings has LOTS of heart. Almost everyone gives this a 10.For anybody who follows international sports, the characters and organizations in this movie ring true. Whether you follow skating, gymnastics, skiing, or any other essentially solo international sports, you have seen the loners, the chosen stars, the politics, fund raising, and everything else that goes on behind and in front of the scenes. John Candy rules as the coach as well as the team.This movie captures those people and circumstances exceptionally well. As has been noted in the coverage of the Olympics, the parallels to Bobsled team are stunning. But it is exactly the dated fashions, music, cinematography, skiing equipment, and attitudes that make it a keeper.Candy is the quintessential American loner, out for his own goals and not interested in serving the needs of his sport, his team, or the international press. It's a character we've seen a thousand times in real life, and it's one who gets deified or demonized depending on his success in the field of sport.I love the line 'If you're not enough without the gold medal you'll never be enough with it'\",\n",
              " \"A serial killer, dubbed Buffalo Bill, has been murdering and skinning young women and the FBI are getting nowhere. Jack Crawford, the agent leading the investigation, decides to try something different; he sends trainee agent Clarice Starling to talk to incarcerated serial killer Hannibal 'The Cannibal' Lector hoping that he might provide some insight; it won't be easy though; Lector likes to play mind games with people and he is soon trying to get young Clarice to reveal some personal secrets. Soon another body is discovered then Buffalo Bill kidnaps another victim; this time the daughter of a US Senator; with the clock ticking before he kills her the FBI offer Lector a deal; unfortunately the doctor in charge of the facility housing Lector tells him the deal isn't real he then arranges another deal and Lector is transferred to Tennessee. Here Clarice sees him one last time and, after revealing details of a childhood trauma, is put on the trail of Bill and into a potentially deadly situation.This is an impressive thriller that is still effective after a quarter of a century and numerous spoofs of some of its most famous scenes. While the story is ostensibly about the hunt for Buffalo Bill it is as much about the growing relationship between Clarice and Lector as he gets her to open up about herself; something she has been warned about doing but does to gain his trust. Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins are both impressive in these roles. The rest of the cast, most notably Scott Glenn as Crawford and Anthony Heald as Dr Chilton are pretty good too. While there aren't a lot of violent scenes those that there are are particularly brutal. As the story approaches its conclusion the tension rises until the conclusion that remains very tense even after several viewings of the film. Overall I'd certainly recommend this to those wanting a solid thriller; just be warned it isn't for the faint-hearted.\",\n",
              " 'If I were to list my all time favorite Westerns, Tombstone would definitely be at the top. I even love the director\\'s cut that was release not to long ago that explained some missing pieces. Some critics have compared Tombstone with Wyatt Earp, which came out a year later. I believe this is an unfair comparison since Tombstone dealt with the events that happened in Tombstone, AZ and Wyatt Earp spanned more of Wyatt Earp\\'s life before Tombstone, his life in Tombstone, and a little of his life after Tombstone.I love this movie because everything was made to look authentic. The facial hair was real, which is awesome... no fake hair on these guys faces. There is a scene with a thunderstorm that roles in and... it\\'s real.One of my favorite scenes is when Wyatt Earp (Kurt Russell), Morgan Earp (Bill Paxton), and Doc Holliday (Val Kilmer) first meet Curly Bill Brocious (Powers Boothe), Ike Clanton (Stephen Lang), and Johnny Ringo (Michael Biehn). In this scene Wyatt is dealing a faro game and he has just signed an autograph for a patron. Curly Bill grabs the autograph out of the man\\'s hand and reads it. Ike jumps in and says that \"law don\\'t go round here.\" Wyatt informs him that he is retired. Johnny Ringo joins the conversation by looking at Doc Holliday and saying that he must be Doc Holliday. An exchange between the two ensues that could have gone wrong when Ringo draws his gun and begins spinning it. However, Doc uses a cup to diffuse the situation by spinning it in the same manner Ringo did.Another favorite scene is when Ike and Frank Stilwell (Thomas Arana) follow Wyatt and the rest of his family to Tucson to take Morgan\\'s body to California. Ike and Frank are tasked to kill Wyatt and Virgil. Before they can complete their task Wyatt kills Frank. Wyatt walks up to a cowering Ike and takes his spur and cuts him at the corner of the mouth. Wyatt informs Ike that he is now a U.S. Marshall and that he is going to hunt down every Cowboy and kill them.The scene at the OK Corral is amazing. It is as close to what really happened as the film could get it without going back to October 26, 1881. I won\\'t describe it because I wouldn\\'t be able to do it justice and I want you to watch the movie if you haven\\'t or again if you have.There are other scenes I liked as well. The movie itself is very good. This would have to be my absolute favorite Western movie of all time. I like this movie so much that I have remembered many of the various lines. Many of the lines Val Kilmer spoke as Doc Holliday are great, including, \"I\\'m your Huckleberry\".I give this 10 stars out of 10. I love this movie. I also recently read an article that told a story in which the original director was let go from this movie. A new director was hired and the production company whittled the script down significantly. Kurt Russell is also responsible for rallying the other actors and crew to finish the movie, said the same article.',\n",
              " 'There is a sequence in the Wes Anderson-directed \"Rushmore\" where a student Max Fischer (Jason Schwartzman) dreams of solving a maths problem which no one in the world has the brains to solve. Watch the sequence carefully for two reasons : It\\'s way too real and that\\'s the funniest sequence in this comedy-drama. \"Rushmore\" is an offbeat comedy that has the power to make your day if you enjoy the genre but can leave you feeling disappointed if you don\\'t.15-year-old Max Fischer is the most famous student of Rushmore, a private school in which he is largely involved in almost all of the extracurricular activities and flunks in most of the subjects when it comes to academics. When he\\'s put on academic probation because of his poor grades, he finds a reason to return to Rushmore when he develops a massive crush on a teacher Rosemary Cross (Olivia Williams). Oblivious to him, his friend Herman Blume (Bill Murray), a wealthy businessman, is also in love with her. The film follows the story of how Max tries to resolve the situation after he learns of Blume\\'s feelings while trying to win Cross\\' heart.The film has a bit of an odd setting because you can\\'t figure out why Anderson has so many characters in the movie if he just wanted to focus on the love triangle. I found myself questioning the need of so many characters if the plot follows the story of just three of them. You don\\'t know where Anderson\\'s getting at with the plot and by the time you almost stop caring, the sub-plot kicks in and the film escalates into a romance.But \"Rushmore\" has got those few moments of genuine humor that you can\\'t help but fall for its charm. The characters, though many, are superbly etched out. The innovative screenplay, jointly written by Anderson and Owen Wilson, is supremely funny in parts. There are these moments where I allowed myself a hearty laugh, like the one where Max tries to get Rosemary Cross fired when he learns that she too has feelings for Blume only to find out that she has already resigned and his plan has backfired.Jason Schwartzman, Bill Murray and Olivia Williams, in their respective roles, are top-notch. The character of Max is oddly likable although you can\\'t shake off the feeling that he was someone you didn\\'t expect to like or wasn\\'t someone who was supposed to turn out the way he has. Schwartzman portrays Max as a stubborn, flimsy human-being and does it with aplomb. I\\'m not quite sure I understood how the characters of Max and Herman Blume develop a firm friendship. Bill Murray, one of the best actors of his generation, sleepwalks through his role. His performance is controlled, expressive and easy to relate to.All in all, \"Rushmore\" is greatly flawed but it has got its heart in the right place. There are a few scenes in the film which look as if they\\'ve been pulled straight out of your life. The plot skims through many genres but ultimately settles for a deeply-felt drama from a talented director. Watch it, if not for anything else, for those quirky moments which make you feel as if you have been in these situations with people like these saying stuff like that.',\n",

From then on couldn\\'t eat my popcorn for the next hour and a bit I was petrified.The whole storyline was pretty standard horror, but those guys really put all their work into making it more than the plot. Without the blood and gore (which I completely expected from the director of Saw), it cut to the sheer terror that the idea of paranormal \"things\" can reach us.It was an absolutely brilliant horror, which still stays with me now (the day after) when opening my cupboards. Outstanding.',\n",
              " 'This film was just okay. Maybe my expectations were too high for Thor 2. I was really hoping it would improve on the first one (which was good but had so much more potential.) I saw some good reviews for this one and some bad ones, so I tried not to have my expectations up TOO high whenever I saw it on my own. Don\\'t get me wrong--it was an enjoyable movie. It had its funny moments, many of them involving Tom Hiddleston. There was also more time spent on Asgard, and Jane finally got some more screen time. But overall, the film was average. Perhaps I was expecting more from it, but it fell down from my expectations (only slightly, as I did not love the first film but thought it was just decent). I really, really wanted to love it, but I didn\\'t. So I guess I was disappointed in it.SPOILER ALERTThe plot of the story was mediocre. We\\'re given a back story about the main antagonist, Malekith, and a little about Asgard and his connection to it, but it\\'s a little incoherent. Which isn\\'t totally bad, I guess, but Malekith\\'s reasons for wanting to destroy Asgard just seem flat to me. He feels like your atypical I-Wanna-Destroy-Your-World type of villain, which has been done many times before.The way they make Jane get possessed by the evil source or whatever that Malekith needs felt like a forced way to have her in Asgard. She spends a lot of time passing out or cowering behind as battles wage on. It gets a little better near the end, where Jane helps Thor defeat Malekith, but overall she isn\\'t given much to do. I don\\'t expect her to be superman or whatever, given that she has no powers, but I wished she had been given more to do as opposed to being the victim of an evil entity. She also doesn\\'t have enough chemistry with Thor to make me feel like they really love each other.Darcy was funny in the first film, and still was to an extent in this one, but there was times when she was annoying. She got too much screen time, and I believe that a comic relief needs less so that they remain funny and not get annoying. Her sidekick, or intern, also feels useless and is used to temporally replace Eric Selvig, who, thanks to Loki, has gone insane and does crazy antics for comic relief.As I mentioned earlier, Loki was fabulous in this film, having very funny one-lines and making smart remarks. However, his motives get a little messy in this film. It makes since that he would be a sort of shades of gray character, but when (and there\\'s a HUGE spoiler coming up here) he is supposedly killed to sacrifice himself for Thor and then appears to be alive and wanting the throne is Asgard as Thor leaves to Earth, I\\'m left confused. What was the point of Loki \"sacrificing\" himself if he wanted the throne? Was he pretending to die so that no one would suspect he\\'d become king? Maybe that\\'s just apart of the mystery of his plot, and I\\'ll have to watch the next film to see. But, as a stand-alone, it\\'s confusing.Odin is reduced to being a jerk for the sake of the plot. He shows little to no concern for Jane when Thor brings her to Asgard until he discovers what she is possessed with. He also basically tells Thor that the only difference between him and Malekith is that he \"will win\" the battle. This seems a little out of character from the Odin we met in the first film, who wanted to be a fair and strong ruler. I know why they did it-- to give Thor a reason to want to stay on Earth--but by making Odin do something that seems so rude kind of turns the audience off from his behavior.Once again, Thor\\'s friends (Sif, Fandral, Volstagg, and Hogun) receive little screen time or anything character development in general. Fandral, Volstagg, and Hogun say little to no words in this film; a possible love triangle between Sif, Thor, and Jane is implied and then quickly gotten rid of. These characters are fun, and I really wish I got to see more of them.Some of the comic relief felt odd. For instance, Selvig is glad when Thor tells him that Loki dies but quickly offers Thor some very awkward condolences. I completely understand why he would want Loki dead--this IS the man that possessed/made Selvig go crazy, after all-but the audience is led to believe that Loki really has died. Maybe they expected us to know that he hadn\\'t? I know that I didn\\'t believe his death, so maybe that\\'s why. But there were other places where the comic relief felt odd, too, mostly exchanges taking place during the battle scenes. At least they were funny.And finally, the film feels entirely too short. I get that they might not want to make it longer for budget reasons, but if that\\'s the case then they shouldn\\'t try and throw in character development. Some things just felt rushed, and some characters feel underdeveloped. Admittedly the length is not as bad as it was in the first film, but this is mostly because we\\'ve already gotten to know the characters and they are now being expanded on.SPOILER ENDSo that\\'s pretty much how I feel about Thor: The Dark World. I guess it sounds like I disliked it more than I liked it, and maybe I do, but it wasn\\'t a bad film. I\\'d watch it again if someone asked me to, and I\\'d laugh at the comical parts and still enjoy the movie. It\\'s just one of those instances where a film is okay, or even good, but could have been better.',\n",

              " 'I have read quite a few reviews and I think a lot of them are missing the point. First, the statement \"Hannah is a drama queen\". Sure, seems to be true, however, you may forget that the show is about 17-year-olds who are likely to overreact. If you don\\'t remember your teenage years that well, watch the documentary that comes after the last episode. An expert talks about how a teenage mind works differently than an adult\\'s and thinks the sadness caused by something bad would last forever. It is also important which way of suicide Hannah chose - I\\'m not an expert, but I know that cutting your wrists is an extremely tough way to die, because it is very painful all along and takes a lot of time. Many people who choose this method are saved, just like Hannah almost is. The tapes left behind with the detailed instructions and extreme care suggest otherwise, but this could have been a way to draw attention as well. Okay, she is very emotional and has problems to open up or step up and act when she should. There are people like this. We are not the same, nobody is perfect, especially not those who get to the point to decide to try and take their own life. If someone gets there, I can imagine they are not just extremely depressed, but also somewhat angry and wanting their revenge on people who hurt them, even if it\\'s not well-grounded and objectively justified - therefore the tapes. (I would also mention the fact that most of the main characters don\\'t have siblings - at least not mentioned in the series - which may have been an important factor of feeling alone.)Second and most important, please remember that you have been watching fiction, not a documentary. As much as there are many \"Hannah Bakers\", there is no actual Hannah Baker. This is a show, meant to entertain and/or make you think (and it has delivered that to me). As such, there may be unrealistic decisions or characters or happenings just to move the story forward. I mean, would you bother complaining about Han Solo, an intergalactic criminal risking his and his best buddy\\'s life in a seemingly hopeless mission for a crazy old man, a beginning of a beautiful friendship and a crush for a princess way out of his league? Think about that.',\n",
              " 'Ghostbusters III spent a quarter century in development hell. Over time the project eventually saw its way into the hands of people who by their own statements make \"feminist propaganda\" (Feig and Dippold, the director and lead writer notably) so that they could exploit the name to get attention for a propaganda piece.This started downwards spiral. People would be turned off by the names and their ultimate goal, which forced the team behind the film to more heavily focus it towards a specific audience (\"political correctness\"/social justice types). While the various problems in this approach could (and have) been gone on at length (such as the massive racism row around Leslie Jones and her character being \"too black\" and \"not black enough\"), basically it was a death sentence for the film.A good example of how this failed is the ending where 4 fat middle aged women go on about how the antagonist of the film shouldn\\'t hurt their boy toy because he is hot and probably has a big dick, then hundreds of soldiers get crushed to death, and then they geld the logo of the original films to \"defeat\" it.Because that is funny, right? And all of that is exactly the same kind of atmosphere the original had, right? :?',\n",
              " \"*** out of ****I wouldn't become bothered at all if this movie has never been released. The Silence Of The Lambs already showed us everything. The characters that are Hannibal Lecter and Clarice Starling, the great performances of Foster and Hopkins and... Buffalo Bill. Hannibal didn't manage to give us a story in the same level or higher than the Silence's. Hannibal is very less frightening than he truly is in the first movie. (Actually, the first one is Manhunter, but I'm talking about those which have Hopkins in the cast). And Starling, now played by Julianne Moore is also less intriguing.I love the Ridley Scott movies, I won't deny this. But this is one of his few disappointing works. In Hannibal there isn't much character development, instead, the movie takes too much time on characters trying to find clues about where they can find Lecter. Moore listens to past recorded conversations with Lecter in headphones, a cop, played by Giancarlo Giannini, sits in front of his computer, believing that he has already met Lecter in person. And there are other secondary characters, partners of Giancarlo, who do whatever must be done in order to catch Lecter. And, also, there is a guy named Mason Verger, played by Gary Oldman.The movie, itself, is based on a plot where Verger wants Lecter captured in order to torture him, like he never could believe, because of a personal vendetta. This is a good story, but no match to the silence of the lambs. I wasn't too shocked either about the brain scene. For me, at most of times, what really counts for a scene to be shocking, is that there must be suffering. When Liotta has his head cut open and eats his own brain, there's no suffering at all, only gore. This might be nasty and shocking too, but not as shocking as Catherine Martin trying to climb that well, screaming desperately, or Marvin Nash, the tortured cop in Reservoir Dogs, when he's groaning like hell.Hannibal is a nice movie to watch, not a bad sequel at all. Its only problem might have been that it simply is a sequel to one of the most successful movies ever made, a best picture motion picture, and it's hard to get to the same level, but it's worth watching it, anyway.\",\n",

The dialogue most of the time was dumb as hell with Jeff Bridges being a d*ck to everyone and insulting his partner every single minute, the actual bank robbers played by 2 great actors Ben Foster and Chris Pine were very one note and bland and they were also pretty annoying at times as well. There's even a big chase scene where Bridges turns on the radio and tells his partner to scream like an Indian i mean common people.

              " 'Punisher: War Zone is possibly the goriest action film I\\'ve seen . But, the goriness is offset by its dark humor. I see it as the type of film that half the people that watch it will \"get\" and the other half will leave midway. Who will enjoy this film? Mostly fans of the MAX comic series and fans of cult films. Does it succeed in its portrayal of the comic? For the most part. It\\'s the most faithful interpretation yet, but it\\'s not without flaws.Positives: The violence level was perfect for the Punisher. Ray Stevenson portrays the Punisher as psychopathic and cold hearted (much like the comic book). His character is refreshing by comparison to the \"soft\" Punisher as played by Thomas Jane. It was really great to watch Doug Hutchison as Loony Bin Jim. He did such a great job that Jigsaw\\'s character didn\\'t seem necessary. The film work was good and looked much like the MAX comics. Negatives: Jigsaw of the film seems more like a henchmen than a villain. Loony Bin Jim (whom is not in the comic series) steals the show as Jigsaws insane brother. I really wish they would have excluded the Jim character and just worked on making Jigsaw a more threatening villain. Most of the supporting cast were okay, but for the most part they really didn\\'t add much to the story and felt like filler to get to the next action scene. What kept me watching was the Punisher, Looney Bin Jim and the never ending body count.What should you expect? A violent action/comedy that takes you on the ride that fans have been waiting for. It\\'s not Citizen Cane, but it\\'s a step in the right direction for the Punisher series. It\\'s cult status is huge already and will be remembered for a long, long time. I just hope it\\'s commercial failure doesn\\'t mean a second one won\\'t be made. 7/10 Stars',\n",
              " \"I am probably still too young to understand the real reasons why SL is hailed as one of the greatest films ever made. It was mostly shot in black and white while virtually all other movies in the decades before and since are in colour, adding even more of a sense of realism to the film. Schindler's List is a story of a man's change of heart and attitude alongside themes of survival, hope, brutality (mostly served by Ralph Fiennes' murderous Amon Goth)and countless other situations for hundreds of Jews. In black and white, the bloody, graphic summary executions of Jews throughout the film were overwhelming, the images freezing me in my seat and imprinting themselves in my mind to this day, but they justifiably implied to you the horrors of the Holocaust like no other movie. The girl in the red coat seems to symbolise, as her fate suggests, that there is no escape from the dominant force. The acting is spotless. Liam Neeson should have won an Oscar for portraying Schindler (I must admit, I am yet to see Tom Hanks in Philadelphia) with an emotional tone, the performance launching him into super-stardom once and for all. Ben Kingsley and Ralph Fiennes also played their parts with the right touch, especially Fiennes whose character also seems to change within, halfway through the film, but only slightly, his insanity still alive as in one scene he randomly snipes numerous Jewish workers from his bedroom. But the star is director Steven Spielberg, who in 1993 made maybe not his most famous movie, other projects such as E.T., Saving Private Ryan, CEOTTK, the Indiana Jones saga also rising forward. But without question, maybe with the exception of Saving Private Ryan, Schindler's List is Spielberg's finest work.\",\n",

Anyone that think the action sequences are killer needs to watch Hero or Grandmasters or any number of other Chinese films. The story was beyond ridiculous and the acting was was just plain bad.

The whole story centers around a misconception of the main character who is in every sense a Christ-like being. I believe that most people who have seen the film have taken it the wrong way. They see it as a slam on humanity. It's not. It's the negative of the picture of Christ's story.There is the myth among the townspeople that the one who is the weakest and most in need is the least powerful. They begin by treating her well. Later, familiarity breeds contempt and in the end they treat her very badly. It's hard to watch all the mistreatment inflicted on her. Still, just enough balance is applied that in the refreshingly unpredictable ending you can still feel sorry for the horrible townspeople. Grace decides that she will use her power to destroy. There is no last monologue where all is settled to the betterment of humanity. There is only brute force and destruction. She allows only a dog to live. What happens when there is power without forgiveness? This question can be applied in many places. If one takes the current situation in Iraq, if one looks at the retaliation that followed September 11, 2001. One can even look at their own life and remember the times when they have had the power to destroy within reach.I'm very glad to have seen this film.

Acting is clearly far better due to the presence of a convincing Hayden Christensen,a very nice work from Natalie Portman(they match very well on screen), a perfect Ewan McGregor and of course Christofer Lee,Temuera Morrison as Jango Fett, Ian McDiarmid as Senator Palpatin.The role of Samuel L Jackson is expanded and his fighting scenes are great. The action is this movie is UNBELIEVABLE.Star Wars means action and we surely get what we want.There are great sequences like the chase of the jedi starfighter by Slave 1 or the fight between Obi-Wan and Fett.The fight in the Geonosis Arena is like nothing you have ever seen in a Star Wars movie.And finally Yoda is the one to watch for in the movie.Yoda as you have never seen or imagine before.Just sit down and enjoy.

              " 'Delving into areas to be explored later in The Matrix and The Truman Show, Alex Proyas\\' 1998 film Dark City examines whether what we call reality is in fact an objective physical presence existing in time and space or simply a simulacrum devised by our own minds or the minds of others. Like The Matrix, Dark City succeeds as both a visually striking and atmospheric science fiction thriller and an inquiry into the subjective nature of memory. Far from being cold or soulless as some critics have claimed, we identify with the characters and their desire to restore truth and beauty to a world grown dark and dead. Though initially unsuccessful, it has been championed by Roger Ebert and others as a cult classic and has been recently released on a Director\\'s Cut DVD that adds eleven minutes to the theatrical release and eliminates the opening narration.While The Matrix posed the question, how do we know what is real and what is a dream? Dark City asks \\x96 are we more than just the sum of our experiences? Is the \"I\" that we know simply the sum of our memories or something vastly different? In both films, one character tries to hold onto something tangibly real while the world around him shapes and shifts. Both films agree that if our reality is a simulation, like lucid dreamers who learn to exert control on the illusory world of their dreams, we have untapped abilities to manipulate the illusion but must be trained to recognize and perfect our powers.Co-written by Proyas and David S. Goyer, John Murdoch (Rufus Sewell) awakes in a bathtub in a seedy hotel room in a city bathed in perpetual darkness, but has no conscious memory of who he is and how he got there. The only thing he learns is that he is a suspect in a string of murders of prostitutes and is being pursued by the police, particularly Inspector Bumstead (William Hurt) and is being given advice by a strange doctor, Dr. Schreber (Kiefer Sutherland) who talks in short, choppy sentences, as if he just ran the New York Marathon. Also hot on his tail are mysterious \"strangers\" who look like the trench coat mafia and have the ability to rearrange the memories in people\\'s lives as easily as remodeling one\\'s apartment, placing the entire city in \"sleep mode\" every midnight while they manipulate people\\'s lives and the look and feel of the city.One sequence is particular in which a working class couple awakes to a lavish dining room complete with chandeliers and a long dining table as if nothing has happened is quite extraordinary. Discovering that he is the only person unaffected by the aliens\\' powers and actually shares some of their \"tuning\" abilities, Murdoch sets out to reconstruct vague memories of his wife Anna (Jennifer Connolly), a night club singer who comes to his support and a place called Shell Beach where he is alleged to have grown up as a boy. As he tries to make sense of his situation, Murdoch discovers that the aliens efforts to transplant people\\'s memories is an attempt to discover the \"soul\" that makes human beings tick and incorporate it into their dying world.Dark City updates the film noir tradition, creating a sepia-toned city of 1940s style architecture with dim-lit caf√©s, retro movie theaters, and a world of dark alleys, a quiet city where in the words of Samuel Beckett\\'s Molloy, \"nothing stirs, has never stirred, will never stir...\" Murdoch, like Molloy, must discover if there is any \"possible end to these wastes where the light never was, nor any upright thing, nor any true foundation, but only these leaning things, forever lapsing and crumbling away, beneath a sky without memory of morning or hope of night.\" Only when he learns the true nature of reality and his ability to control it can he undertake a battle for the city and for his dream that Shell Beach can become more than a picture postcard.Note: The director\\'s cut menu offers three expanded commentary tracks\\x97by Proyas, by Dobbs and Goyer, and by Ebert.

Yeah so its a pretty basic who done it type movie besides the whole Alaska thing.But what I love about this movie is the realism that Christopher Nolan is famous for. Even before he was known for Batman his movies had that amazing look Nolan is famous for. The cinematography is incredible. Its like a travel brochure for Alaska! Its simply amazing. The story is great. It leaves you in suspense wondering whats going on but in a good way. And not to spoil anything but the reason its called INSOMNIA is its filmed in the part of summer where the sun never sets (sort of the same as the movie 30 days of night). It just adds to the films allure.So if you like great crime movies in the \"Who done it\" genre and you haven\\'t seen this flick? Where have you been!?!

We must have watched that rubber penis ten times trying to get past that mark. I mention this because it says something both about my complicated relationship to my parents and sex, and about the slight forgettability of the rest of the film.Still, the fact that the film pales a bit alongside Scorsese\\'s other great gangster films does not make it bad, in fact it is a solid piece of work. The Departed eschews some of the lavish style of movies like Goodfellas and Casino, possibly because the source demands a somewhat grittier presentation, by, aside from a couple of neon glowing scenes and a weirdly gratuitous cocaine orgy scene, keeping the visual excess to a minimum and playing the soundtrack rather safe with things like Pink Floyd and The Rolling Stones \\x96 Gimme Shelter is played at least twice, but I gotta admit, it\\'s the perfect song to make a badass entrance to.However, the plot, about a policeman infiltrating the mob while a mob guy is infiltrating the police, is brilliantly constructed, especially during the latter half where Scorsese turns the tension of who will be exposed first up to eleven. The fact that both camps are full of \"good guys\" and \"bad guys\" helps blur the line between the two, which is a recurring theme in the dialogue. There\\'s an inherent growing sense of distrust and paranoia in the central conflict that the film could probably squeeze more out of, but DiCaprio conveys it quite well in his emotionally troubled undercover cop. The suspense reaches its height during two excellent scenes; first, an intense alley chase, and second, an equally intense phone call between the two infiltrators. The only thing that doesn\\'t really work with them is the somewhat contrived subplot in which they both sleep with the same woman. It would be unfair to single out The Departed among the host of gangster films but it\\'s like it didn\\'t even show up for the Bechdel test.I have to revise my opinion about the violent two-part climax which I previously thought had an air of silliness to it, as it actually plays quite perfectly into the whole blurred distinction between good and evil. There\\'s something ironic? fateful? nihilistic? about it and it reminded me of those old French heist movies like Rififi and Le doulos. The departed, good or bad, handsome or ugly, rich or poor, are all equal now.',\n",
              " \"OK, so I picked up the Twilight books about a year ago and I was ecstatic to find that they were making a movie. My roommate kept telling me that there were awful reviews but I still walked in with an open mind and not to high of expectations that it would be like the book. After seeing the movie, I am not very sure if I liked or I didn't. I felt that the acting between Bella and Edward was very awkward and lacking the chemistry that many reviews said they had. You could tell that Robert Patterson was trying to cover up his British accent. Also they developed the story a little more in some places rather than others which is where it should have been. I know that there was no way the director could have fit that long and that amazing of a book into a few short hours and expect everyone to be somewhat entertained however I expected a lot more. At least with Harry Potter, the director stayed very close to the book and allowed every single movie to have its magic even though it was changed a little bit. In order to determine whether the movie was good or not I will have to see it a second time and I suggest that anyone who goes to see this movie if they already haven't to be prepared for something that does not really have any extremely wonderful in it.\",\n",
              " 'Before I go anywhere with this, let me just say that I would of LOVED to review this event as two sepperate films with two seppart scores on two sepperate marks on the score sheet, but because the film really is meant to be an experience, I have no choice but to review it as one film. Planet TerrorFrom beginning to end, Planet Terror is all kinds of awesome, it\\'s easily the best zombie movie since 28 Days Later. The entire film is one huge roller coaster. If you like blood, guns, and explosions, this is pretty much bliss. The film starts with an infection affecting a whole small town in Texas. Before you can say \"Machine Gun Leg\" there are zombies everywhere. Slowly but surely, the three sets of characters come together (And we don\\'t really even see exactly how, thanks to a brilliantly placed \"missing reel\") and kick ass.It\\'s worth warning that Planet Terror is a TON of fun, but it\\'s also pretty bloody, in fact, it makes other bloodbaths like Kill Bill, Sin City, and 300 look like chick flicks in comparison. But it\\'s all for the fun of it. If you like zombies and blood, Planet Terror is worth the price of admission. 5/5Death ProofLord almighty, if Death Proof would of been half a good as Planet Terror, Grindhouse would of gone down as a classic. Sadly, it\\'s not. It\\'s actually got an eye on Norbit as wanting to be the WORST movie of the year. Heres the premise, two women, sit in a car...and talk.....and talk...and talk...and...stop for dinner...and TALK!! It\\'s really an hour and 15 minutes of talking, with 10 minutes of car chases, and if you think the car chase is WORTH the bloody talking, think again. Even Kurt Russell himself can\\'t save this film from being boring and unnecessary. It\\'s really a shame, because the entire experience is truly authentic grindhouse. 2/5Now, for the experience itself. It DOES admittably feel very authentic, and I have to give an extra point for the incredible fake trailers. If they made a movie with just 10 or 20 fake trailers strung together, it would of been incredible. There are also tons of scratches and missing frames in the film, and great \"missing reels\" in both movies. There\\'s even a taco shop ad somewhere in there. All in all, this is an experience for the ages, it is pretty unbelievably epic, that being said, there\\'s really no reason to stick around for Death ProofScore: 8/10',\n",
              " 'As a WWII buff for over 30 Years I add some Historical and Technical discrepancies i saw: Tank scene with the Tiger: 1, I highly doubt, the Sherman crews could realize from where the shots came from, for sure not in the short time showed. These bullets had no tracers and travel faster as sound.2, The Tiger was one of the few Tanks who could pivot on place. It would be near impossible for the Fury tank to flank it like it did in the Movie. But it did not need it anyway, because the 76mm gun could easily penetrate the Tigers side armor from far away, no need to get at his back.Also, shooting while driving was not a common tactic. Move, stop, firing.Attacking the Forrest: 1, Pitt said he heard an 88 because of the sound, but they were Pak 40 instead. Flak 88 were really rare on the battlefield, because they belonged to Air or home defend units and many times you had to ask Hitler himself to free some up for the Wehrmacht. Also, the Germans would never drag a big 88 deep into a Forrest.2, At these ranges, the Pak (Anti-Tank gun) could\\'n miss. Also the Film try to suggest the tank crews were able to reload faster as the Pak, but it should be the other way. A Pak crew has far more freedom of movement for reloading and a far better all around situational awareness.3, Deep in the Forrest dug in and camouflaged you can\\'t see a Pak, maybe the muzzle flashes, but you have to estimate the range. The proper tactic would have been, the tanks sitting far outside and giving support fire and Inf taking out the Pak\\'s, if no Arty and Air was available.4, I don\\'t know the rules for the US Army, but it was forbidden for Wehrmacht Soldiers to move behind tanks, it\\'s a big bullet magnet. Also, the Germans would add into her defense line some crossfire like positions with overlapping fields of fire. Most likely, after the first ambush, they would have switched positions anyway, because of the deadly US Arty that would have followed.Last stand: 1, This wasn\\'t a Battalion, more likely a single company(120-250 Men at War times) 2, A German unit would not approach such an area in march formation.3, To take down a tracked tank you don\\'t need explosives. A bit grease and a crow bar would do it. Blind it and bend the MG barrels. Stuff things into gun barrel.4, Why would anybody climb on a enemy tank from the front? 5, Like others mentioned here, no one would ever shoot with small arms at a tank, when friendlies are around. Those ricocheting rounds would kill more of your own men as the tank could ever inflict.6, Soldiers don\\'t take comrades as cover, never! Everyone in the Army knows that a full rifle round can go through 5 guys standing in a line.7, \"We peel of your skin\" Hello? Who would ever say this? Some swearing I would expect, but this sounds like the creator of this Movie tried to make them look like some NS-Mengele-Konzentration Camp defenders, to make them really bad looking.Overview: This Film is so full of flaws, it\\'s not even funny. The Myth and stereotyping about elite SS-Units is really annoying. There were only a half dozen real elite Waffen-SS units. The ones who fought in the western Theater were mainly Hitler Youth like the 12. SS Div. or consisted from foreign Volunteers. Most of the Waffen-SS weren\\'t Germans at all. This doesn\\'t mean they were bad, it\\'s only a fact. The real elite units of the 3. Reich were Paratroops, Mountain units, Pioneers and the usual professional soldiers of the Wehrmacht. In the Polish campaign they had to withdraw SS-Units because of overconfidence and heroic actions who lead to high casualty\\'s among them.For a pure Tank film, you see so little about what makes out tank combat. And there are no informational scenes who shows the audience, without Army background, what really happens, especially on both sides. Best example is the last scene were the German officer rallies his troops only to tell them \"Take them, because it\\'s our Country\". WTF? Even 6. graders would make a plan! Hollywood should stop showing German Soldiers who run around like headless chickens. And always showing crying Soldiers as if dieing would come so unexpected. Your Adrenalin level would skyrocketed after a battle, you then don\\'t cry like a baby.The dialogs are horrible, sounds like some red neck created that Movie. You really get the feeling, this crew is the dumbest the US-Army could muster. When you see post war interviews with Tank aces how polite and even funny they can be, you wont believe a thing in that movie.',\n",
              " \"Up until the day yesterday we have debated if we wanted to see Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 (2017) in the theaters or if we were gonna just wait to watch it on Amazon. Many things made us wait though most importantly the thing that made us so stand-offish was the trailer and marketing.The marketing pushed the film as hard as they tend to do for films that need that extra push because it will fall short in the theater, we've seen many of those films; though this was not the case in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2. Turns out that Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 (2017) is one of those rare cases that the sequel was quite possibly better than the first, they did an amazing job with this film.As usual, we won't give any spoilers and we will only focus on what makes this films good. The acting is exactly what you'd expect though a few cameo's in the film I do think they should've left the falling stars out of it, but what's done is done.

              " 'Pitch perfect. So Tarantino actually made at least one film that doesn\\'t allow viewers to get high on gore, and does require some concentration to get it. No wonder people didn\\'t like it. Jackie Brown is like a Coen Bros. script directed by Tarantino. A bunch of people all scrambling for a bagful of cash - except unlike a Coen Bros. movie, these people aren\\'t all morons, and someone manages to get away. The director executes it like a pro, never letting a viewer\\'s attention wane.The dialog in this film is smart and sober. Samuel L. Jackson is the epitome of scum, and plus he\\'s badass to the core. Pam Grier is an absolute FOX. These two were born to play their parts. The casting is uniformly perfect - except De Niro. I have no clue what he was doing here - seems like the studio wanted more \"star value\". He sleepwalks through the whole thing, dragging down the quality of the entire film.Overall this film is just a BIT slow. A couple of places require some speeding up, but on the whole the mood and pace is perfect. The character of Jackie Brown is one of the most interesting things Tarantino has come up with. He seems to have very quickly realized that his fans don\\'t want anything even remotely resembling substance, and so he went commercial big-time with his next project. Kill Bill struck the mother lode. Its eerie; the man has a frightening grasp of the average movie-goer\\'s likes and dislikes.',\n",
              " \"Starting with dream-like visual thanks to the bright colour pallet, quick filming style and framing, Moonrise Kingdom is the latest film to come from the strange world of Wes Anderson that should delight fans and most newcomers to his work.On the New England island of New Penzance, this quirky 1965 set adventure tells the story of two 12-year-olds, orphan Sam Shakusky (Jared Gilman) and the troubled Suzy Bishop (Kara Hayward), two runaways who try to escape their dysfunctional lives. As their friendship and romance starts to bloom the island's police chief, Captain Sharp (Bruce Willis) leads a search with Scout Master Ward (Edward Norton), Suzy's lawyers parents (Bill Murphy and Frances McDormand), and a troop of boy scouts to find the wayward youths as the film becomes more and more surreal and provides plenty of what the hell moments.There will be people who would be hostile to Anderson's work and style, but Moonrise Kingdom should still be able to entertain the majority of filmgoers because of the excellent screenplay that provides a touching story, witty characters, and excellent jokes. The witty dialogue was enhanced by great performances, particularly from Willis and Norton who both have engaging screen presence.Anderson's gives us a technically wonderful film that uses tracking shots to keep the flow of the comedy going as foreground and background gags are presents. There are beautifully framed shots of the actors when the character is focused on them and long takes to maximise the performances. The cinematography of wide shots, the locations, and set design helps adds to the surrealism of this world and some of the more whimsical scenes as the children adventure into the wild.Moonrise Kingdom is lead by two first time child actors and they do a fine job; both Gilman and Hayward should go far in acting if they choose to continue. Moonrise Kingdom is a typical story about two outsiders who embark on a unusual friendship that becomes a more adult romantic one in nature. Be warned, there will be semi-naked prepubescent children on screen, which add creepiness to proceedings. The film would have failed if Gilman and Hayward were not compelling performers, but they were up to the job.Both children come from dysfunctional backgrounds, a continuous theme of Anderson films. Sam is an orphan who is describe as emotionally disturbed but even though he is a little eccentric, he is a decent kid and for the most part it is just a case of a boy's situation forcing a label on him. His former parents were selfish, passing the buck because they did not know how to deal with Sam.On the other hand, Suzy is from a well-off middle class family, yet she is the one with emotional issues, ranging from being cold and distance to a willingness to use violence. She is a product of her environment because her parents hardly communicate with each other except for legal speak and use megaphones to round up the children. Suzy is of course going to act out in an environment like this. It is an illustration that problems involving childhood exist in the middle classes and that parents over complicate the issue instead of tackling it head one.The parents and guardians are selfish, only caring about themselves instead of the children. Anderson uses Tilda Swinton's character to take satirical swipes at Social Services who look at a child's file more then the child themselves. The adults argue and fall into an anarchical state, even Willis and Norton who play the more likable of the adult characters are still faulted in their actions, lives, and/or abilities.Throughout the majority of the film is the percussion heavy music in the background that keeps up the tempo and rarely stops. It gives the film a more dramatic tone as the action builds up; it sometimes gives a western feel as the children survive in the wild or tension during the various chases the children endure.Moonrise Kingdom is a strange and surreal experience that will provide smiles and chuckles when you are soaked into Anderson's weird world. It will appeal mostly to Anderson's loyal fans, but there is still enough material in the film for non-fans to enjoy as we examine an unusual friendship.Please visit www.playeraffinity.com\",\n",
              " 'So, this is my first review ever and i write it just because of all these negative ones i read here.Actually, i was pretty skeptical about this film because a) I thought the first one was just \"okay\", but sometimes way too cheesy with an obvious lack of depth and b) the new director Apart from that i never read the books and have no emotional commitment to this franchise.Nevertheless, i watched it today, and it\\'s great. Yeah, you could argue that it\\'s too long, or the end may come to abrupt, but i didn\\'t feel either way. Time flew by, the idea of this whole concept remains interesting, while the whole revolution idea gives it an unexpected depth. The performances are all okay, or good, and you especially feel with Katniss, thanks to J. Lawrence. After watching the film, you literally can\\'t wait for the next one, and although the film looses his pace at the end and very much happens in a very short time, its ending remains well enough satisfying. Yeah, you may ask yourself from time to time: \"What? How? Who?\" - but most of these questions are answered within the movie. Its crucial, though, to remember some things from the first installment.All i can say is that i went into this one without any high expectation, and got good, slightly emotional entertaining which builds up massive potential for future films.

I feel that this movie was well-made. The writer must have taken lots of time to write a movie of such high-caliber. Granted, there may be lag times, but overall, the plot keeps you thinking all through the movie. Every twist and turn has you wondering \"what will happen next?\"In my opinion, this movie deserves some Oscars when the time comes.

The most critical might be the one that other two girls were not trying to escape while James is chasing the Karate girl, for they were on escape mindset when this is happening.Some parts are slow paced and might be boring, but, that is due to the disclosure of details (regarding past lives of characters).

              " \"Or so says one of the characters early on in Scream 2, which is followed by a short discussion about sequels that might just be better than the original. Is Scream 2 one of them? Definitely not. The first Scream film worked well because it played with the rules of the slasherflick (although it is far less original in this than you might think, as Wes Craven's own New Nightmare did pretty much the same thing) without subverting them and because it brought a much needed energy back into the genre. I don't think Scream is a true horror classic (I didn't think it was very scary), but it's still great fun. Scream 2 aimes for pretty much the same thing. It's another postmodern slasher where the characters know the rules of the genre and where the filmmakers play around with them.Sometimes, it still works. The whole sequel-discussion will please anyone with a casual interest in film, the cameos by Heather Graham and Tori Spelling (as Neve Campbell's character in the movie-within-the-movie based on the events in Scream) are cleverly inserted into the film and there's even a hint the filmmakers are trying to confound the audience' expectations (one slashing is an example in particular). It's not as though Kevin Williamson's film-literate script is a complete waste of time. But apart from these clever flourishes, there's very little here. Sure, he throws in 'subtexts' like the media's obsession with violence and, more notably and bravely, the whole relationship between violence in media (and film in particular) and in real-life. But as it doesn't do a lot with its subtexts, so what you're left with is your usual barrage of killings and a whodunnit storyline. And a lot of it isn't nearly as sharp as Scream. The dialogue has its moments, but the character interplay is as shallow as possible and there's an awful scene where Neve Campbell has to dodge a real knife among fake ones in a stage play. It's the type of hugely theatrical scene that doesn't work at all in this type of film. Apart from that, the conclusion to the whole whodunnit isn't nearly as satisfying as Scream's.What makes it worse is the rushed execution. Wes Craven is a gifted horror director and not a gifted stylist and Scream 2 brings out the worst in him. The entire film is shot in a dull, predictable fashion and at times it almost looks (cinematographically, anyway) random. Worse even is the handling of the typical horror film staples. The shocks are telegraphed early but don't work because of clumsy editing (the first 'shock' is a case in point). The gore level is very low (actually, apart from the sound effects there is nearly no real gore) and it doesn't have any atmosphere. Craven is talented, but here he's clearly rushed his work in order to release before the genre dies again.And that's the whole film's problem, it feels too rushed. Which is also noticeable in the music, where they use part of the Broken Arrow soundtrack as Dewey's theme (or is this a VERY misguided popculture reference?). I really think with (a lot) more polishing Scream 2 could have a competent, enjoyable romp, but as is, it's only occasionally entertaining.Rating: 5/10\",\n",
              " 'After two incredible masterpieces, \"There Will Be Blood\" and \"The Master\", I was awaiting whatever Paul Thomas Anderson would be doing next with baited breath. However, as it turns out, \"Inherent Vice\" is a bit of a let down. Based on high-brow literary author Thomas Pynchon\\'s book of the same name, the film has an impressive cast and, as one would expect, interesting dialogue. However, the whole thing gets somewhat bogged down by an incomprehensible plot, and ends up feeling even longer than its already sizable 150-minute runtime would suggest. Perhaps this was just a case of overambition on Anderson\\'s part, a skilled director adapting for the screen a novel whose themes and plot are simply too dense to translate into film. Despite all of this, your time will not be wasted on this film. But make sure you go into the theater fresh and pay good attention, otherwise you may just nod off (as my partner did).7/10PS: the film is narrated by my personal all-time favorite recording artist, Joanna Newsom, who also plays the minor roll of Sortilege.

              " \"I've recently read many reviews from posters and critics. And it seemed that there are far too many negative comments on this board about Spider-man 2. Much of the criticism is because of the fact that there is more romance and seemed more like a love story. This can be true but I disagree, the romance and action/adventure with suspense is great in this film. I enjoyed the first one but I gotta say that this was one better. The story was more developed along with the characters and it felt better. The CGI was better and so were the action scenes. Also the characters felt more ral as they showed more emotino and depth. There was far more suspense. Especially the scenes where Harry find out that Peter Parker is Spiderman, same with Mary-Jane. Also the scene in the train was great, and the ending was nice. The villain in this one (Doc.Oc) was more developed and it had a better story. In Spider-Man (2002) the villain- Green Goblin looked like some sort of a power ranger bad villain and his face didn't move when he moved, and the costume looked rather cheap, where as in this one the villain looks very sophisticated & realistic. Spider-man 2 was going at a pretty good pace all the way to the end. The acting is improved and really great especially by Tobey Maguire. Overall a brilliant comic book movie & equally as good as X-men 2. A perfect 10/10 for this amazing movie.\",\n",

              " \"I saw it at the 11:59 pm Thursday May 3rd showing at a local cinema. I have been waiting for this film for years and was psyched about Venom and seeing them explore Spidey's dark side. However, the more I think about it, the more I was let down.Spider-man 2 blew my socks off. I went back and saw it several times in the cinema. The latest installment however...What worked for S2-character driven plot-line. While S3 was too somewhat, I didn't care for them this time around. Had they focused solely on Venom or Sandman it would have been much better. We saw Doc Ock as a man who was in love, someone you could be friends with. We saw the tragic death of his wife and his slow decent into 'madness'. They tried to do that with Marko but failed. So when he creeps up into the little girl's room I was thinking 'oh god, not in a kid's room, are you crazy?' Then he looks at her. He could be a pedophile for all I know. Only later do we learn he is her father. If we had been shown some time he spent in jail, reading letters from her, humanising him more, maybe then I would have felt bad for him and sympathised. All we see of Marko is him for 2 minutes as a man, the rest of the time he is a pile of sand. Yay. How am I supposed to feel anything for some sand?Now Venom... love Venom, great bad guy. Visually I think they did a great job, but there wasn't enough time spent showing him vs. Spidey. Venom's powers are at least twice that of Spider-mans, but we never get to see that. We're never really told or shown how his webbing is stronger, that HE is stronger. They really should have spent more time showing the evolution of Brock and his build-up of animosity towards Parker. Instead, what do we see? He begs Peter not to ruin his career then two seconds later he's at the church asking God to kill him. Oh, and don't even get me started on Black Spidey. OK, I totally get what they were trying to do with Peter's new hair, but somehow it was uncomfortable. So much so that whenever he would appear on screen with that hair, half the cinema audience would laugh. It just didn't work. And in the beginning, we immediately see Peter not as we knew him, but self- absorbed. Where's the Peter we knew from the last movie? That's the Peter I wanted to see and didn't see until the very end where he forgives Marko. They should have kept him like that until he first learned of Marko killing Ben, then let his dark side emerge, not before. Before that moment there was no reason for the symbiote to be attracted to him, because it's attracted to aggression. When it latched onto Pete's bike in the park, there was no aggression there!All in all, there was just too much going on. Too many plot lines, too many subplots. They did well with Harry and Jameson of course. Bruce Campbell's part was fantastic as always. Mary Jane wasn't bad either. Will I buy it when it comes out on DVD? Probably, but I doubt I'll pay $8 to see in in the theatre again.\",\n",

              " 'Set in the Civil War \"Gone WIth The WInd\" tells the story of beautiful Scarlett O\\'Hara. She\\'s manipulative but you feel sympathetic for her which speaks for Vivien Leigh\\'s outstanding performance. Scarlett marries three times. One time for revenge to hurt her one true love, Ashley. Who never loves her, but kind of keeps her hanging, always talking to Scarlett about \"honor\" being the reason why he cannot give himself to her. So he was not totally innocent in the romantic debacle between the two.Her second marriage is for money and convenience. Third time to Rhett Butler. Clark Gable is another one of Scarlett\\'s \"victims\", the one man who truly loved Scarlett, but Scarletts scheming to win Ashley finally kills the love he had for Scarlett.The final quarter of the movie is one awful tragedy after another for Scarlett.With each viewing, I grow to love this movie more. The most unforgettable scene is where Scarlett is walking through town where the wounded/dead soldiers are laying and the camera pans out further and further until you see the rebel flag waving and to me it is the defining scene of this film. The cinematography is beautiful and the special effects can rival the effects we have today. A cinematic feast. Do not miss this.',\n",
              " \"Brad Pitt has gone from youthful sex symbol to versatile actor and producer. His biggest project to date is this filmic adaptation of Max (Mel's son) Brooks' novel, World War Z, chronicling a massive, worldwide zombie apocalypse. For a subgenre that has ranged from classic horror, (Night of the Living Dead), to science fiction, (Resident Evil), to modern updates, (Dawn of the Dead remake), and parodies, (Zombieland and Shaun of the Dead), this film represents a rare depiction of the zombie invasion as a global, mass annihilation. Previously, these films focused on a small group of survivors (TV's The Walking Dead) with a news blackout and no idea as to the magnitude of the infection. After publicized problems with the screenplay and director Mark Forster's (Monsters Ball, Finding Neverland) rough cut (particularly a climactic battle scene), a new ending was shot, and the result is a remarkably engaging film. Gerry (Brad Pitt) and his wife, Karin (Mireille Enos), ready their two daughters for school and get caught in a traffic jam in downtown Philadelphia. Suddenly all hell breaks loose and panic sets in amid an invasion of zombies who are bent on mindlessly attacking and converting humans into the undead. As cities fall worldwide, the infection spreads exponentially with startling speed as the family flees to Newark for supplies and a lifeline from Gerry's former UN boss, but while the family finds a brief refuge aboard a US Navy ship, Gerry is called into service to find the source of the infection or risk having his family kicked off the ship as non-essential personnel. Tracking down random clues across the globe in such disparate locales as South Korea, Israel, and Wales, the trail for a cause and potential cure proves challenging as time runs out on humanity. In many ways, this film, which shares much in common with pandemic tales as Contagion, Outbreak, and The Andromeda Strain, is more a thriller than horror, and that's not a bad thing. Rather than relying on gross out murders and graphic blood spattered effects, this film looks at the bigger picture without sacrificing the more intimate moments of sheer terror, not an easy balance. Don't let that PG13 rating fool you! Some scenes are suspenseful and agonizing as the threat of zombies is ever present. The film, particularly in the Newark apartment scenes and an unbearable moment of truth at a World Health Organization lab, is like one big funhouse ride where the scares are just around the corner. Other memorable set pieces include the opening pandemonium in Philly, which is well crafted and builds to an alarming level, a walled in city of Jerusalem stunningly challenged by a growing sea of undead, and perhaps the best moment, a horrifying passenger plane flight from hell that starts innocently enough but quickly devolves into an impossible situation.The film takes the scary notion of fast running zombies from 28 Days Later and adds even more lethal traits as in their ability to not only swarm like insects, but to hurl themselves with great ferocity at their intended victims even through car windshields. Their victims aren't devoured as in other films, but rather a bite turns them into more zombies almost instantaneously. They are also real sensitive to sound as Gerry learns at the worst possible moment.What distinguishes this film above most others is its smarts. The script, while written by many hands, still shows an intelligent approach to a devastating crisis, and the dialogue never sounds phony. Further, the film is like one big mystery with nature's clues in full view waiting for Gerry to piece together a solution. Some of the plot points are a bit open ended and push the limits of plausibility, but things move so swiftly and convincingly, that most won't mind. The supporting cast is effective in brief roles with a strong turn by Daniella Kertesz as a soldier. But this is Pitt's show, and he is the right leading man who has the presence and charisma to carry even a zombie film. Being able to improvise and display cool under pressure, he is the ideal savior that the world needs. Perhaps his Gerry is guilty of being too perfect, but he does it so well.(It is amusing to note that Gerry and his family become guardians of an orphaned boy, and one wonders if Angelina Jolie was smiling at the parallels with her and Pitt's real life, nuclear family.)With a mega-budgeted production, the CG effects are a standout especially when creating the hoards of zombies, and there are many effective camera shots with some particularly startling, overhead views. There is also great use of sound effects that add to the visceral chills while the brooding, pulsing music score (Marco Beltrami) complements the tension. A thrill ride from beginning to end, World War Z is a thoroughly entertaining, scary epic that takes the zombie lore and heightens the stakes with an impressive budget and a star turn by an actor/producer at the top of his game.\",\n",

              " 'This review is specifically for the 3D re-release. There are two things that I observed, one was that the strength of story and surprise is about double the effort compared to recent Pixar releases. \"Brave\\'s\" story felt relatively simplistic, \"Cars 2\" offered no depth. \"Toy Story 3\", while having depth, was still basically a rehash of TS2. \"Finding Nemo\" exceeds expectations every few minutes. Once the story seems set, a new wrinkle is thrown in. I had not watched the movie in a while, and I forgot how fast-paced and action-packed the story is. There are many more moments of genuine humour compared to recent Pixar releases. Second was the quality of the 3D. Most reviews I heard was that the 3D wasn\\'t all that special. I disagree. There are many moments, albeit brief, where you are tracking along with the fish through an underwaterfall, or animals flying toward the camera, or settings that surround you with 3D depth. The animation is still probably Pixar\\'s best. The vivid recreation of a coral reef is vibrant with colour. The swilling motion of everything from the current, the refraction of the sun through the water, even the aquarium is lovingly depicting with exotic objects. Seeing the film on the big screen also gives you the benefit of feeling the sense of size when a large shark or whale dominates the screen. Now, not surprisingly, Pixar is making \"Finding Nemo 2\". As much as I applaud this film, Pixar has a better chance to impress with something original instead of churning out sequels. Hopefully they will stuff it full of good story and surprise elements for a change.',\n",

There isn't ANY and I bet they have forgotten it all five minutes after leaving the theatre. Tarantino is a magpie who 'borrows' from other films constantly.

There are two ways to look at this. Maybe this film can be enjoyed alone and not with others OR as is the case with most movies you have to identify with the lead character.Much has been said about how the book has been hollywoodized or how Chris was not a doomed romantic hero but a stupid cretin with a death wish. But that isn't what the movie is all about.Into the wild is about many things. It is about natures importance in our lives. It is about peace and love and human relationships. It is about solitude. But mostly it is a coming of age story.Emile Hirsch stars in this movie as Christopher Mcandless a 24 year old college graduate who ventures into the mountains of Alaska to escape from it all. His parent's treachery and the lies that surround him. Hirsch does a beautiful job of playing Chris. He completely inhabits the role and brings out a staggering performance. Since Sean Penn himself is such a great actor maybe it was easy to bring out a performance of this magnitude in another. The film is aided by a perfect supporting cast. Every single person in this movie has done a good job. Right from Vince Vaughn to Jena Malone who plays Chris' sister and she also narrates the movie.Credit must be given to Sean Penn. You can see that in the movie there is a perfect amalgamation of the filmmakers thoughts , feelings and vision with the subject matter and that gives us a truly wondrous film.\",\n",

Although different to the previous instalments, 'Furious 7' still delivered with bigger and crazier stunts than what we have ever seen before. I have been a fan of the franchise since early days and since Paul Walker passed away I have been longing to see this instalment, and it did nothing but blow me away from the outset. From the brilliant fights to crazy car chases, this film put you on the edge of your seat feeling like part of the action. Once again the family behind fast & furious have done another outstanding job. Finally it was a fitting and emotional send off for Paul, and an amazing tribute to the legend that graced our screens and he will live on in his fans hearts forever. This films is a must see and won't leave you feeling disappointed and worth a watch for Paul walkers last ride.\",\n",
              " 'It was absolutely refreshing to see an alien invasion movie which does not try to compensate a weak screenplay with excessive special effects and Hollywood stars. On the opposite, Attack the Block preferred to employ ingenuity, perfect direction and competent performances in order to make us believe the battle between fierce aliens and a tenacious teen gang.Director and screenwriter Joe Cornish initially presents the \"heroes\" as amoral criminals and social parasites, something which makes it difficult for us to empathize with them. But the trick is, of course, in taking advantage of the alien invasion for them to find the value, altruism or at least the geniality to redeem them and put us on their side. And I think that the movie shows the characters\\' evolution on a credible way, to the point in which I ended up empathizing with the characters.And besides of the narrative aspect being brilliant, Attack the Block does not neglect the visual aspect either. Needless to say that we will not see huge fleets of UFOs, nor epic battles between the army and the invaders; but the movie managed to generate suspense and makes us believe the ferocity from the creatures without the need of those ornaments. Speaking of which, I found the alien design simultaneously practical, realistic and creative, because they come to life with a minimum number of special effects. Besides, the cinematography increments the sensation of threaten and paranoia, while the abundant humor moments work very well.Despite a few questionable decisions from the screenplay, I liked Attack the Block very much, and I can definitely give it a very enthusiastic recommendation as an excellent alien invasion movie.',\n",
              " \"Not only is this movie one of the greatest ever filmed, it is also one of my favorites. The thought of men fighting for a country and cause that isn't even theirs inspires me. I do not know any people now that would do that and it seems to me that these men should be honored beyond just in history books. A whole round table, once full, is down to six knights and their leader, Arthur. To me, that is the sad. All those men died because some Roman, a man that wouldn't take care of his own problems, ordered them to risk their lives in battles that they had nothing to do with. Arthur and his knights were amazing. The knights fought for Arthur because they loved and trusted him. There is no higher power than freedom and those who believe otherwise need a brain check.

              " \"Tim Burton takes another stab at directing a film starring the beloved caped crusader, The Dark Knight of Gotham City, Batman. Whereas in the first film, Batman felt a bit overshadowed by the campy Joker character, but now Batman has up to three adversaries that you care more about than the title star. Catwoman, a revenge seeking feline imitator. The Penguin, a criminal who was actually raised by penguins. And Max Shreck... And that is it. Sometimes I felt myself actually rooting for Catwoman to kick the snot out of Batman and just due the guy in because Bruce Wayne felt so unimaginative and boring. Which isn't good being as though Tim Burton has the imagination of a hawk's eye and got too wrapped in the visuals of the film. Looking like Gotham is one thing, but feeling like Gotham is another. Tim Burton's direction is not very inventive, although he does seem to know where to go and who to focus on in any given moment. Danny Elfman's score was (of course) the best part of the entire film minus Michelle Pfeiffer's performance as the sexy Catwoman. So what do we have? Pros: #1 - Danny Elfman's Score #2 - Tim Burton's Visual Style #3 - Michelle Pfeiffer/CatwomanCons: #1 - Unimaginative Cinematography #2 - Overshadowing of the Main Character #3 - A Weak Story Without Characters To Match\",\n",
              " \"Colour and lighting, Fincher emphasizes shadows and dimly lit scenes--the kind that lend more to the tone of the shot than to the ego of the star. You'd be hard pressed to find any light situation in any of his films that truly flatters the actors. Se7en is definitely Fincher's darkest movie--in mood and in lighting. The majority of Se7en contains very little light, the crime scenes being the most notable examples. In fact, most of Se7en's lighting is directional, meaning that it comes from an artificial source focused in one direction with a low falloff. The brightness of the desert setting during the climax is a dramatic shift from the rest of the movie and is perfect for the change in tone and action of the finale. The most interesting use of colour in Se7en comes when Mills and Somerset explore John Doe's apartment. Everything is, of course, red and dark. Camera work and editing, The chase scene with Mills and Doe is about as exciting as they come. The camera moves quickly with the characters, and the odd angles keep the audience from seeing everything--building paranoia and escalating the tension. The steady movement of the SWAT team as they descend upon the sloth victim is another well-choreographed sequence. All of Fincher's films feature some kind of chase scene, which is definitely a good thing, considering how effectively he pulls them off. Production and set design, A lot of the settings are buildings in decay; many of them were built from scratch and then made to look worn. I believe that Fincher often films on sets rather than scouting out interior locations because actual interiors rarely live up to his meticulous imagination. Rotting wood, rust, water stains and peeling paint all help to make each scene totally believable--more like moody still life's than movie sets.In the spirit of rule breaking, Fincher makes his credits ascend upwards. I'm not sure if this is the first time this has ever been done, but it's the only movie I have seen it in. Aside from scrolling up, the credits are also visually interesting. Careless lines and scratches weave in and out of text.\",\n",

There is just too much in the book to condense into one movie, unless one makes a 5 hour movie. I have loved the casting for this series from the beginning, watching Harry, Hermione and Ron grow up has been a treat. I have read, more than once, all the books and Deathly Hallows is my favorite, and the movie I just finished watching is a credit to the book. Yes, there are changes, some threads (minor) missing but the spirit, the atmosphere, is all there. I particularly enjoyed Rhys Ifans portrayal of Xenophilius Lovegood, quite believable. The photography was outstanding and the apparition scenes fantastic. They came across better on screen than they did in my imagination. I keep reviewing the book in my mind, looking for a flaw or an error in the movie and I can't find one. I recommend this movie and am eagerly awaiting the second part.\",\n",
              " 'My friend Dmitry thinks that Mary Harron is prejudiced against the male characters. Also Dmitry hates \"it was all a dream\" stories, of which he considers \"American Psycho\" one. He thinks the movie fails as tragedy and comedy, because there are no consequences for Patrick Bateman.Here\\'s part of his letter to me regarding this film:\"what\\'s the point of the story? is it about a shark among sharks who has a touch of humanity which makes him hate himself and disagree with the world he lives in - then what\\'s the sacrifice? or the tragedy? he leaves his fianc√© and makes the false confession but it\\'s not enough, dramatically. ed norton confesses to the police. then shoots himself in the mouth. that\\'s sacrifice. the point of \"American Psycho\", i guess, is that he has no way to redeem himself and that\\'s the tragedy. that would be fine if not for all the murders. and again, if they are in his head and he thinks they are real then he is not merely having a nervous breakdown (which he never really has) but he is psychotic and that\\'s never dealt with. \"Following is a response I wrote him in 2007: Bateman is psychotic, which is all that is dealt with, in my opinion. Start with the title. And the fact that everything he does is nuts. Even his friends kind of think he\\'s weird, and they\\'re barely awake enough to recognize him. He is Tantalus, staring at his own reflection and failing to grasp it until he goes mad with coveting himself.The joke of this story, I think, is a man trying desperately to have a tragedy, or a comedy, or any kind of a dramatic life, but he\\'s just a doofus who happens to be very rich. He\\'s Bruce Wayne without a good idea in his head. He\\'s unable to really have, for instance, a sense of accomplishment, or a need unfulfilled, or a sense of loss, or values, really - since he\\'s at the very, very top of Olympus, having achieved the top 2% of the planet in terms of resources (women and $100 plates and blow and limousines), he should be able to be happy. BUT THERE IS NO DRAMA IN HAVING EVERYTHING. So that\\'s the comic premise: he can\\'t have a tragedy, and he is driven mad by the attempt. The tragedy would be \"A Clockwork Orange\", a man so blas√© and jaded that he follows the baser impulses of popular culture because it really doesn\\'t matter what he does since society\\'s such wreckage anyway, and whose real tragedy is that he actually can fulfill himself and be happy by doing evil, a more cynical sensibility than I think is found in \"American Psycho\".At this point, I think there are two valid ways to look at what constitutes the story.One is that he hasn\\'t really committed these murders which should be horrific but aren\\'t, and that he\\'s having a nervous breakdown from trying so hard to transgress and being so impotent that his sex fantasies have become indistinguishable in his retarded mind from his real life. His fantasies, also, are not enough to make his life interesting; fantasies never are; and he is just an empty Lord & Taylor bag that a homeless man is using for a pillow. His friends see this, aren\\'t interested enough to pity him, or, worse, think his confession is just a joke that they don\\'t really get, so they kind of laugh along until their feelings are hurt. In trying to suffer punishment he only receives minor scorn. He is such a failure, a cipher, that even his crimes don\\'t really exist. This is an okay interpretation, but less interesting than: The other way you could look at it, which is that he\\'s so desperate for passion and fulfillment that, like Hercules, he really did commit these crimes, but that AGAIN THERE ARE ZERO CONSEQUENCES. When he confesses and nobody believes him, and even when his friends offer evidence to the contrary, that\\'s just because they\\'re as stupid as he is, and that they mistook him for someone else and also mistook his victim for someone else and they\\'re all interchangeable anyway, and that it\\'s just too much trouble for these people even to help the detective find the murderer, since nobody really liked Paul Allen in the first place. Anyway they\\'re all self-absorbed and inattentive to really important details, not like \"which restaurant shall we go to,\" which is a minor detail that\\'s very important to them, but big details like \"who am I talking to?\" I think this is the funnier interpretation, and I think that the movie ends on enough of an ambiguous note to allow for it.It is an imperfect film. It has great performances, many great scenes, a few very nice recurring themes, and many flaws. The disappearing detective is as you point out a problem. There is contempt in the lens, which I agree is to no one\\'s advantage. I think we should see the guys hanging out more, see more of what pathetic losers they are, or more of how he\\'s more or less screwed up than they. There is too much time spent with the character alone. To really get Travis Bickle\\'s alienation, we don\\'t only show him alone in his apartment playing G. Gordon and writing cryptic messages to himself. We show him at the movies.But man, Christian Bale on the phone, talking to that answering machine. So beautiful. We are capable of so much, we humans.

During the film Vada experiences his Dad falling in love with Shelly (Jamie Lee Curtis)who does make up for the corpses, her obsession with death, her period, her grandmother having Alzheimer's and Thomas J dying of bee stings (he had an allergy to everything).

              " 'There have been quite a few R-rated comedies this year, but they\\'ve all left something to be desired. Your Highness collapsed under being nothing but improvised toilet humor, The Hangover Part II was a complete rehash of the original, Hall Pass was just a disappointing attempt by the Farrelly brothers, and Bad Teacher was too tame to really be called \"bad\" at all. Paul and Bridesmaids were both pretty decent, but Paul wasn\\'t nearly as good as the movies Simon Pegg and Nick Frost collaborated with Edgar Wright on and Bridesmaids pretty much played out like every other Judd Apatow movie out there. It was beginning to feel like every R-rated comedy from here on out would be so similar to everything before it that the laughs it tried to provide wouldn\\'t be very funny at all. Thankfully, Horrible Bosses came along to prove that theory wrong.What\\'s interesting is that Horrible Bosses kind of follows the same formula as The Hangover; three guys getting themselves into a really terrible situation but roofies are replaced with a crazy scheme to kill their bosses. The funniest aspect of the movie lies within three guys, Nick (Jason Bateman), Dale (Charlie Day), and Kurt (Jason Sudeikis), obviously having no idea what they\\'re getting themselves into and dealing with the situation in the worst way imaginable. Things get really crazy really fast and only get more hectic as the movie jogs along. That\\'s essentially the movie\\'s charm. While the formulas to the two movies are similar, Horrible Bosses does seem to offer quite a bit more than The Hangover.The cast may be the strongest factor of the movie though as nearly everybody involved makes the most of their screen time and manages to get a laugh or two in no matter if they\\'re a recognized name or a new face. Kevin Spacey, Colin Farrell, and Jennifer Aniston play the three bosses and they\\'re all fantastic in their roles. Spacey just goes out of his way to be the most despicable person anyone could really come across while Farrell, despite being selfish and greedy, still manages to toss in a few pretty hysterical one-liners. Aniston will probably be the one that sticks out the most since she makes the biggest impact by being rather forward with her sexual desires for Dale. It\\'s just such a different role from what Aniston has played in the past. The chemistry between Bateman, Day, and Sudeikis is really spot-on, as well. Their conversations, fighting amongst each other and interactions just make you really believe that these three have known each other for years. Even though his role is a little small, Jamie Foxx deserves a mention as well. Dean Jones turns out to just be a really entertaining character overall.It\\'s difficult to point out any sort of problems this comedy really has, if there are any at all. The film is extremely vulgar, but doesn\\'t really feel entirely too crude or include any gross out gags like many R-rated comedies seem to fall victim to. None of the cast drags the movie down as they all do their part to drive the movie forward. I feel like it won\\'t be as successful as some would think though and will be overshadowed by other comedies that aren\\'t nearly as solid or as funny as Horrible Bosses is. That\\'s really the only complaint anyone could possibly have.Horrible Bosses is easily the most hilarious R-rated comedy of the summer. The strong cast, amusing dialogue, and entertaining banter between Nick, Dale, and Kurt is more than enough to sky rocket Horrible Bosses to the top of the list of comedies released this year. Charlie Day will have you laughing right from the start. Luckily, Horrible Bosses came along to inject some much needed hilarity into mainstream comedy this season.',\n",

              " \"Haven't we already had some movies that touched on this kind of would-be journalism? Wasn't there a movie called Paparazzo back in about 2004, or something like that? Didn't Joe Pesci once make something called 'Jimmy Hollywood' back in the early 90s that had a similar theme? True, those movies are not specifically about gruesome crime journalism, but the idea of edgy loners going out and merely showing up with a camera didn't sound too original. I was hoping for more than I got. That said, Nightcrawler is not going to bore you. It may only make you wish they had done it better. The story deals with an asocial loner (Gyllenhaal) attempting to break into television journalism with nothing more than a camera and a police scanner. Clueless at first, the young man discovers he has good instincts. Then, he finds a ratings-challenged news station that is willing to pay him good money for gory footage of crime and accidents; things the mean streets of L.A. would seem to have a lot of. Within mere moments of screen time, Gyllenhaal has graduated to having a fast sports car, top shelf equipment, and even an assistant. His footage is a potential career saver for TV journalist Rene Russo. But there is competition for this bloody footage (surprisingly little, though) and soon Jake finds himself not only recording the blood, but sometimes thinking he has to cause it as well. He finds himself compelled to sabotage his primary competitor, demand sexual favors from Russo, withhold the identities of multi-murderers, and even sacrifice his partner's life. When will his world come crashing down on him? Or will it?That little synopsis is more compelling than many of the scenes. The script plays like a first draft, with no major plot twists that you cannot see coming from a mile away. Some possibilities are offered, then left to dry up on the vine. The manner in which Jake films the mass shooting at a swanky home, leads the viewer to expect that he will in fact be a suspect in the crime. It would not surprise me to learn there is a different draft in which they did actually go that route, and some of the shots were set up to move the story in that direction. Alas, Jake is merely accused only of withholding the identities of the killers. A detective threatens him harshly at his apartment about the possibility he could be charged with obstruction and whatnot. NOTHING comes of this scene. Nothing. Gyllenhaal's performance is uneven. In the first half of the film, he seems to be aping Travis Bickle with his asocial honesty and lack of people skills. By the second act, he is a cold know-it-all who talks down to his assistant and the people at the TV station. By the film's final act, he is a slick, slimy pseudo TV producer. It just doesn't seem like he'd morph so quickly. And if this business is so competitive, why is Bill Paxton the only other guy who seems to show up and compete for footage? This coulda, and shoulda been better. 6 of 10 stars.The Hound.\",\n",
              " \"This movie was supposed to be a amazing experience for the comic book readers and the film enthusiasts. Instead it created more division than unity. And I'm not talking about the Batfans going against Superman-fans. This movie has so many mixed opinions. It's okay if you hate it or loved it. But I'm stuck in the middle. It brought us one of the best Batman after Christian Bale's performance. And also some fight scenes and CGI that was killer. But the motives were very unclear. The Mother Issue was a complete turn off and a let down. The build-up is absolutely pointless as the battle ends with them becoming friends by the mentioning of a name that can literally be mentioned at any given moment. If Batman was Batman he could easily listened to what Superman had to say about his mother. And Superman could have easily swooped him from the sky and taken him down. Point is this movie should have been called Fans vs Rotten Tomatoes: Dawn of Disappointment.\",\n",
              " 'The worst thing you can say about freshman director Andrew Douglas\\' remake of the 1979 haunted house chiller \"The Amityville Horror\" (*** out of ****) is that nobody gets killed, unless you count the six people gunned down in their sleep during the atmospheric opening sequence. Those first few eerie moments of this supernatural saga recreate the true-life murders that an insane Ronald Defeo, Jr., committed at the infamous Dutch Colonial house located at 112 Ocean Avenue in Amityville on November 13, 1974. Hardcore horror fans who rate fright flicks based on their body count will dismiss \"The Amityville Horror\" as tame. They won\\'t find this horror picture in the same league as either the gruesome \"Saw\" or the ingenious \"What Lies Beneath.\" On the other hand, the complaint that audiences consistently make about haunted houses movies is: why don\\'t the fools in the house have enough sense to clear out before they get a taste of their own blood? Interestingly, \"The Amityville Horror\" proves an exception to the rule. The Lutz family skedaddle before they die. Sorry, if I spoiled the ending. Not only did the family get away in the original, but also they manage to escape in the remake. In fact, since the family that vamoosed in real life hasn\\'t died yet, \"Texas Chainsaw Massacre\" scenarist Scott Kosar and Douglas can reasonably call \"The Amityville Horror\" a true story. Like the 1979 version, the new \"Amityville Horror\" draws on the reportedly \\'true events\\' that author Jay Anson chronicled in his bestselling book \"The Amityville Horror.\" However, everything that transpires between the times that the Lutz family set foot on the premises until they abandon both their person belongings and the house qualifies as either fabrication or exaggeration. Nevertheless, \"The Amityville Horror\" emerges as an above-average shocker that surpasses the original in both horror and humor in spite of its happy ending. These days Hollywood likes to make horror movies where evil triumphs over good. Society has grown so cynical that horror movies with upbeat endings are a relic of the past.Essentially, \"The Amityville Horror\" depicts the American dream gone to Hell. George (Ryan Reynolds of \"Blade: Trinity\") and Kathy Lutz (Melissa George of \"Dark City\") are newlyweds out house hunting when they discover the deal of their lives in Long Island. The adage that you should worry about what you want, because you might get it lies at the heart of \"The Amityville Horror.\" Initially, George believes that they cannot afford such a large mansion, until they learn that the price has been scaled down significantly because of the Defeo murders. George warns Kathy that they will have to live like misers to survive, and Kathy shrieks with delight when he consents to sign the papers. Afterward, unlike the original where James Brolin and Margo Kidder knew about the murders from the get-go, our heroes find out after they inked the contract that a psychotic Italian twentysomething impulsively\\x97Ronald Defeo, Jr.,--shot his mother, father, and four brothers and sisters. At his trial, the killer told the jury that he heard voices ordering him to carry out the execution-style murders. Naturally, George and Kathy withhold the truth from their impressionable children: Billy Lutz (Jesse James of \"The Butterfly Effect\"), Michael Lutz (Jimmy Bennett of \"Hostage\") and Chelsea Lutz (Chloe Moretz of \"Heart of the Beholder\"). No sooner has this big happy family moved into their dream house than things take a turn for the worst. Cathy\\'s children still miss their real dad who died from cancer, and they have a hard time bonding with their new stepfather. Similarly, it takes George a while to adjust to fatherhood. The timeless evil spirits lurking in the creepy Dutch Colonial house divide and conqueror the family, turning them against each other. George finds it extremely difficult to stay warm, so he starts chopping wood, more wood than a legion of lumberjacks could hack up. At one point, he forces a rebellious Billy to hold the wood while he swings an axe with terrifying accuracy, splintering the wood into halves while barely missing Billy\\'s hands. Little Chelsea conjures up an invisible playmate named Jodi (newcomer Isabella Connor) who turns out to be the ghost of one of the dead Defeo family. Jodi died in what now serves as Chelsea\\'s closet where Jodi\\'s brother blew a quarter-sized hole through her forehead with a high-powered rifle. Now, Jodi exerts an uncanny, hypnotic power over Chelsea and forces her to disobey her mother. Before they flee the house, the Lutz family is literally clawing at each other\\'s throats. George makes some alarming discoveries about the basement where an 18th century madman performed ritualistic torture, rather like the Spanish Inquisition, on helpless Native Americans.Chiefly, the remake differs in many respects from the original. First, Douglas and Kosar have whittled the running time down to under 90 minutes, compared with the original\\'s near two hour length. Second, they have eliminated some subplots. The subplot about the Catholic priest (Rod Steiger) who blesses the house, hears a voice demanding his departure, then later suffers a nervous breakdown has been drastically altered. Douglas and Kosar have pared this subplot down to only two scenes with one priest. The original also dragged in a detective who maintained surveillance on the Lutzes. This character has also been cut out. Third, the remake pushes more fact than fiction. When George Lutz tears up the basement and finds another room, it isn\\'t a doorway to Hell brimming with sludge and flies. In the Jay Anson novel and the original movie, Jodi appeared as a pig. The performances are better than you\\'d imagine, especially Ryan Reynolds as a poor man\\'s Jack Nicholson from \"The Shining.\" The children cast as the Lutz kids are wonderfully convincing, particular Jesse James. This handsomely-produced remake of \"The Amityville Horror\" is no \"Shining,\" but it tops other recent horror pictures like \"Hide and Seek\" and \"The Grudge.\"',\n",

Nicholas Cage earns all credit he can get and the director must have known that it would turn out to a success after talking him into doing the movie. They jump into action already in the first minute. There are some sequences when it's challenging not to get goose bumps. The fact that the second clue is written on the back of the Declaration of Independence is hair rising. Aside of all spectacular happenings, they manage to squeeze in a love story. The cooperation of Cage and his friend is also brilliantly done. In conclusion, the audio sounds real good and there are also many natural sceneries.

              " 'MANY SPOILERS FOLLOW!!!One of the main problems with this movie is that it explicates certain directives important to planting ideas and then the movie doesn\\'t follow them. In one scene, Gordon-Levitt is shooting at some bad guys, then Hardy comes over and says, \"Dream bigger,\" and pulls out a grenade launcher. This, coupled with Page\\'s manipulation of the dream early on, seems to indicate that there is power to change what is in the dream. Yet when the van is under attack, the driver only has a crappy pistol. Seriously? What about the directive that an idea has to be simple enough to seem that it springs from the subject\\'s own mind, otherwise they will know its true genesis lies outside them. But the filmmakers steal from many films and don\\'t think the audience will recognize their genesis. People have already mentioned Paprika, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, and the Matrix. But there is also in the Cobb/Moll storyline a lot taken from What Dreams May Come. Plus there are Escher stairs that turn into Harry Potter stairs. Personally, even with the hours (felt like) of explication the film did, I never understood how they actually shared dreams. They get wired into a dream? I thought the tube was for what the chemist mixed. How does that allow the dream to be shared? And limbo? Seriously? What a cop out. You remove something that made sense (you die, you wake up) and turn it into ridiculousness--now you\\'re shoved down into pure subconscious and you can\\'t really survive there b/c your brains become scrambled. Yikes. There was plenty more that was problematic, but others here have covered or, I\\'m sure, will cover that, too. This movie would have been better if it hadn\\'t tried to do so much. Again the trailers were misleading and I thought the plot was going to focus on the ins/outs of many dreams/dreamers. More than a waste of money, it was a waste of time.',\n",

The second movie goes by the rule \"the same, only more of it\". The third movie has the same rule as the second movie, but this time it twists the situations around a bit more and organizes the characters differently. Often the third film is known as \"darker than the other two\" (have you ever noticed how often that happens?). Thus, we have Pirates of the Caribbean: At World\\'s End, the almost three-hour action adventure story featuring Jack Sparrow.I like it! But then again, who doesn\\'t? It\\'s exactly what it promises to be, and that\\'s what makes it good. The rule of thumb for this situation is, if you liked the other two, then you\\'ll like this one. If you didn\\'t like the other two, then why are you even taking the time to read a review of this one? C\\'mon man, it\\'s more of the same! Just go out to see it like you\\'re supposed to.Anyway, the plot is a little lengthy and convoluted to detail in this space at this moment (plus I\\'m still a little exhausted from it, so it\\'s kind of hard to write all that much about it), but the whole company is back and battling the forces of evil, which I think is the trading company and their new merger, The Flying Dutchman, but since the ongoing joke is that pirates are only self-interested, really it\\'s more like a continuous saga of bickering with each other. Captain Barbossa is back, but unfortunately Geoffrey Rush and Johnny Depp aren\\'t given as much time to be foils to each other, which is literally the relationship that set off the series and really made the first movie so much fun to watch. However, at least there\\'s enough Jack to go around and have seconds, and best of all, there\\'s the scene where Jack goes slowly insane... which is one of the most fun and funniest moments in contemporary mainstream cinema! I loved it! If there\\'s anything I would really say is \"poor\" about this movie, it would be the unfortunate tendency of the music to play over the dialog.

The movie was very violent but at many parts it was very good.

There are many fight scenes in this movie and I think that it kind of keeps the movie going. They do not talk about the killed father at the beginning much, but they do mention him to keep Amsterdam in place. Cameron Diaz\\' character was not very beneficial to the story but she did add an interesting part of the story. The torture scene that Amsterdam is in looked very painful and very unnecessary. Amsterdam\\'s revenge on his father\\'s killer went downhill for him after that torture scene. After Jenny helped Amsterdam out she was not really needed. So pretty much, Amsterdam did a good job trying to kill his father\\'s murderer and Jenny was not really needed in the story.

Was there more to be played with on screen? AbsolutelyThe attention to detail in the sets was phenomenal, the graffiti in the gas station bathroom really drew your attention, sadly it took away from the on screen bond between Ward and Jakoby. Sadly it seemed that this was another outing for deadshot and his backup crew (jakoby and tikka). The focus was always on Smiths character and if I'm being brutally honest. His portrayal wasn't all that good. Jakoby was given cheesy one liners that didn't really seem to flow with the script or have a genuine interaction with his on screen co stars. Could it have been the voice he was putting on, or because he wasn't used to that amount of special fx make up? Some of the other main Orc characters managed to convey all kinds of emotion. So why couldn't Edgerton. The introduction of the Elves (Leila and her henchelves) what a trio they were and delivered some of the best action scenes in the film. It's a shame we didn't get to know a little more about them, why she was doing what she was doing and how was it going to pan out going forward.I really wanted to see an action scene with Kandomere, you can't just waltz a dude with blue hair and a badass suit on screen and not at least tease us with some mad elf combat skills. I mean, come on, use all the characters and tease their potential.Don't get me wrong, the movie is worth a watch and it is an amazing concept for a film. I just wish David Ayers had pushed it that extra notch and delivered something truly amazing. He should have learnt to do so from his time with Suicide Squad, yes less can sometimes be more but when you've got ¬£90,000,000 budget, I wouldn't have picked such high paid actors (Smith) to take on such a project.Overall, I'd say this would have been better without Will Smith and could have done with casting some unknown up and coming actors to take these Netflix projects to great heights.

              " 'To say that I have been looking forward to this movie for quite some time would be an understatement. Based on the novel by Thomas Pynchon \"Inherent Vice\" promises on face value promises to be a comedic madcap homage to classic film noir mysteries such as Howard Hawks\\' \"The Big Sleep\", Roman Polanski\\'s \"Chinatown\", Joel and Ethan Coen\\'s \"The Big Lebowski\" among others. There are elements of all of those films in IV yet it remains definitively a Paul Thomas Anderson film. In a veiled way it invokes the spirit Anderson\\'s previous feature the infuriatingly impenetrable \"The Master\".What Inherent Vice does in a much more relatable way is capturing the passing of time through the eyes of its characters, like a torrent of sand passing through their fingers. The characters must deal with the implications of events that reopen old wounds that time has healed and sometime in the opposite direction. The inspired soundtrack also invokes these sentiments Neil Young\\'s \"Journey Through the Past\" and Chuck Jackson\\'s \"Any Day Now\".Joaquin Phoenix shows a significant amount of restraint playing stoner detective Larry \"Doc\" Sportello. There is a point in the film where everything gets built up to the point where Doc needs one big whiteboard to properly piece together enormity of the difficulties he finds himself in, it was rather refreshing to see a movie be so self-conscious of its own perplexities, maybe a visual aid to some of the more befuddled members of the audience. In addition there is the ever expanding plot, featuring a cacophony of ludicrous situations. There are many setpieces and sequences with side splitting laugh out loud moments.The supporting cast are what really elevate the film, carrying it through its lengthy runtime. In particular Martin Short\\'s suave, drug addict, money laundering dentist \"Dr. Rudy Blatnoyd\", Josh Brolin\\'s square police Lieutenant \"Christian F. \"Bigfoot\" Bjornsen and Katherine Waterston as Doc\\'s ex the seductive \"Shasta Fay Hepworth\".It feels like a hazy semi lucid trip, floating in and out of focus as the sixties end and the seventies begin. It\\'s captured through the dusty melancholic cinematography of Robert Elswit, the result is something akin to what would play in a double feature alongside Robert Altman\\'s \"The Long Goodbye\" of which this is demonstrably a heavy influence. It is almost certainly a film that was made to be not only portray the seventies but to be a movie that could nearly be transported back there also, if that was Anderson\\'s intention with Inherent Vice he has truly succeeded. In terms of where this stands amongst PTA\\'s more revered films, I don\\'t see it reaching the heights of other entries in his back catalogue. Personally, I think this is some of the most unique, inspired and interesting work he\\'s done. It\\'s an entertaining journey, with a terrific protagonist, insane humour and outstanding performances.

If you do (and didn't have to Google to find the answer), this reboot of the Friday franchise is for you! Michael Bay manages to tone down the overt humor of more recent Friday installments, ditch the lame supernatural elements completely, and resurrect Jason as the crazed, reclusive, wild man that he was originally portrayed as in Friday the 13th Part II.Bay's burlap sack-wearing psycho is a nice homage to the earlier (i.e., scary) films in the franchise, taking the best bits of Jason from the original film, as well as Parts II and III, and molding them into a clever, violent, predator.For the first time in almost two decades, Jason isn't portrayed as a slow-moving, mentally deficient, zombie with supernatural powers and an arsenal of running prop gags that put Carrot Top to shame. This is a good thing.This new, re-imagined, Jason made it much easier for me to suspend my disbelief than any of Hodder's incarnations have and the payoff was some genuine discomfort.As for the gore \\x97 it's stylish. Recalling the artful executions of the Italian Giallo genre, the kill scenes in this new Friday (from an arrow through the head to an instance of sleeping bag immolation) are brutal enough to shock but not on screen long enough to be tasteless.Now, in an age dominated by the rampant excess of Eli Roth, stylish gore and tasteful brutality are lost on many theater patrons \\x97 which is why I opened this review as I did. If you answered that question, you know that the best gore is defined by execution, not excess.Bay gets it right. The kill scenes in this new Friday feature are absolutely artistic.And the nudity? Let's talk about the nudity \\x97 a lot of people are convinced that teenage breasts are a fundamental feature of slasher films. Those people are going to be disappointed with the new Friday. Really disappointed. Thankfully, I'm not one of those people! As somebody who has watched a great many slasher films from around the world, I'm convinced that gratuitous nudity is indulged only in the worst films that the genre has to offer, serving as a device to distract the predominantly male audience members from a work's otherwise obvious pitfalls.The short version of a much longer thesis is that the more gratuitous nudity a slasher flick contains, the thinner the plot, the worse the acting, and the less worthy it is of your hard-earned cash. Bay's new horror epic contains a single scene of prolonged partial nudity.Finally, let's look at the acting. Going in, one will do well to remember that this is a slasher flick and that most acting will consist of screaming, bleeding, or running through the woods screaming *and* bleeding. If you're looking for Oscar material here, you're looking in the wrong place (and arguably the wrong film genre).The screaming and bleeding is something that the actors in this new Friday the 13th have down pat. Predictably, however, things fall down in the dramatic acting department. This isn't to say that the acting is bad \\x97 it's absolutely not. It just isn't very memorable. The real star of this move is the mute, axe-wielding, maniac.So, the final verdict? Well, again, it all depends on if you can answer my first question without cheating. If you can, see this movie. If you can't? Well, you'll probably be better off watching the next re-skinned Scream retread.\",\n",
              " 'I wasn\\'t surprised when it won. The \"oh, he/she has never won, so we\\'ve got to give it to he/she\" has been VERY busy the last few years. Plus, I hadn\\'t seen it. I was really looking forward to it. WOW!! This was bad in a number of ways, but mainly because this has to be the worst screenplay EVER to win any Oscar, never mind a best pic. How else was it bad? Casting Nicholson as a tough guy that would scare everyone else has always been a laugh. Nicholson is a little pisant. He wouldn\\'t last a year in South Boston, never mind decades. Nicholson\\'s games with hookers were pointless and just distracting. The woman shrink, whatever her name was, sleeping with both Damon and DiCaprio was ridiculous. Wahlberg (was that him? I hadn\\'t known he was in the pic, and for a few minutes I thought Damon was playing two characters.), looked and sounded like a local village idiot in Charlestown. Truly, the entire police force, local, state and FBI couldn\\'t have lit a 100 watt bulb. The idea that Nicholson\\'s character wouldn\\'t have fingered and killed DiCaprio\\'s character quickly is also ridiculous. Let\\'s see. Nicholson has, oh, a half-dozen henchmen, all of whom have been with him for YEARS, all of whom have KILLED for him. Then DiCaprio shows up. He is an EX-COP! Hicholson takes him in. About a year later, it becomes clear there is a rat in the group. Gee, who do we suspect? Now here is one that gets a little tricky. I noticed the guy told DiCaprio to go to #314 instead of #344. The guy noticed that DiCaprio still showed up at #344. Now, we aren\\'t sure if that guy was an undercover cop or not. The TV said he was. Nicholson doubted it. If the guy wasn\\'t a rat, why didn\\'t he tell his cohorts that DiCaprio was, ahem, suspicious. Gee you think?Another reason it is so ridiculous he hadn\\'t killed DiCaprio by then. When the TV fingers one of his guys as a rat, Nicholson won\\'t believe it, though he knows there is one. This is like a \"which one doesn\\'t belong in this group\" game for a 2 year old, but Nicholson failed it!There were a few more crazy plot holes and foolish setups. It was hard to keep up with them. As for the almost everybody-gets-shot-in-the-head ending, don\\'t get me started. There are too many inanities there to begin. At least Wahlberg\\'s village idiot knows how to put on foot covers. Was that to hide the fact that he didn\\'t know how to tie his shoes?All in all, I understand why MS got the Oscar. The direction and acting was pretty good. But, giving this a Best Pic or voting it anything over a 6 is ridiculous.',\n",

Then scene where Blondie is pushed over the limit by The Ugly you are in shock as you can't believe it's happening but then it all just shifts around and suddenly one need the other to find all the buried money and then they are going on a mission in finding the gold. Suddenly you realize it's going to be bad as they get to the graveyard and it's absolutely huge. Then in all motion and looking for grave The Bad comes to the door and gets them to listen him after finding gold isn't there he is forced to take a challenge by The Good and it was so tense that you just start feeling anxious and just break little by little. Shootout is happening and you are stunned just in the moment you realize what happened and everything is getting to it's place. The end is coming and just once again just don't believe The Good is going to leave The Ugly hanging there, then he comes out and shots the rope and leaves leaving you just amazed.

              " 'SPOILERS Well, it would seem that the director of Fatal Attraction, a movie about a man with a fickle pickle amongst a bunch of olives, has \"broadened\" his \"artistic horizons\" by bringing us a movie about a woman cheating on her husband.The plot? Wife cheats on husband. Husband hires a private dick, says nothing to wife. Husband kills the second guy, police ask a few questions, husband dumps body. This is stuff for Made-for-TV movies, which is surely why I felt shafted (no pun intended) after paying the price of a movie ticket to watch a movie with a banal, hackneyed plot.The acting from Gere and Lane was (perhaps unintentionally) over the top, which in and of itself is quite irritating, although it does serve as a nice distraction from the plot (variations of which can probably be found in a few of those paperbacks sitting near the drugstore checkout). My particular favourite scene was Gere acting like a man pretending to be sick -- delightfully amusing, although that obviously wasn\\'t the intent.The cinematography was thoroughly inconsistent. There were, admittedly, a few well-shot scenes, sensitive to the space and environment of the scene, particularly in the Frenchman\\'s apartment. All in all, however, it left much to be desired, and there were surely a few scenes that could easily been reshot with greater attention to quality. Instead, one is left with a Sony HandyCam feeling.I\\'d recommend taking the money you\\'d spend on tickets to see this movie and instead go out for dinner. You\\'ll thank me later.',\n",

But things go horribly wrong, and poor Fool finds himself trapped in this crazy house, replete with booby traps; kidnapped, mutilated, cannibalistic hostages; possibly the most persistently nasty Rottweiler in screen history; AND the sickest brother-and-sister team you\\'ve ever seen.

              " \"How the mighty have fallen. It is hard to believe that this film was written by the same people as the first SATC movie and the TV series. In the span of 2 years the apple has fallen too far from the tree. This film has no resemblance to its predecessor nor the series. The characters have totally lost the plot and their personalities, not to mention their sense of style, intelligence and self respect.The movie starts off on a bad note already with a very clich√©d, airy-fairy overly stereotypical gay wedding which in the real series never would have happened, because these characters totally despised each other and had absolutely nothing in common. So from the start it is obvious the writer was out of ideas as to plot and storyline, killing the film's credibility in the first 10 minutes.There are also unfunny offensive 'jokes' as well as ghastly wardrobe choices, and an unnatural Stepford Wife-like robotness to all the characters.SATC2 oozes desperation from every orifice: The desperate writer Michael Patrick King who couldn't come up with anything worthy of a movie; The whole production team and actors desperate to cash in on the success of the first film. Then the characters: desperate gay 'couple' who settle for each other with no intention of faithfulness; age-fearing Samantha desperately trying to stop menopause; desperate Carrie still in search of the fairy-tale perfect man that real life will never deliver; Miranda desperately trying to prove herself equal with men in her career while sacrificing family; and Charlotte desperately clinging to her perfect WASP designer life, breaking down when she cannot keep up appearances with two little children.SATC2 is these shallow characters putting their vanity, ignorance and stupidity on display and when they land in Morocco (or Abu Dhabi as we are supposed to believe) the movie becomes an unwatchable cringe-fest. SATC2 not only showcases the intended ignorance of the characters but also the unintended blatant ignorance of the writer and all the people involved. The cultural gaffes are just too many to list. Let's just say it is the epitome of the 'ugly American tourist': rude, stupid, ignorant, naive and self-aggrandizing to the core.I also don't understand why the makers insisted on setting the movie in Abu Dhabi even though they were not allowed to film there and instead shot in Morocco. Why hype and deride a city, country, and culture they have never been to and know nothing about? Why not just set it in Morocco, a country which itself is beautiful and culturally rich but cosmopolitan enough for these western women to enjoy on some level? It just doesn't make sense unless the makers were intentionally trying to mislead the viewers to think that the UAE though rich is an anti-female stone-age 'evil-muslim' backwater? (Which of course could not be further from the truth). If that's the case, then SATC2 is nothing but an American propaganda film, which makes it even sadder than it already is.\",\n",

This premise just didn't make sense to me, and as it was presented early in the movie, I watched the whole thing with disbelief. Other than this this movie does everything right though. The music is a joy to hear throughout, though jazz isn't my thing. Watching it being taught and practiced is interesting. The main actors do a terrific job and are perfectly credible.

              " 'If you\\'ve seen this movie, you know what I\\'m talking about here. If not, go watch it. It\\'s a great piece for the most part but prepare to be disappointed. Basically a deadbeat one-hit wonder/father/ex-husband (Keaton) who once posed as famous superhero, Birdman, struggles with success, relevance and being genuine. However he is poisoned by his alter ego (Birdman) who is self-entitled, lazy, arrogant and a devout believer in cheap thrills aka explosions, tits, guns, Michael Bay and so on. Of course Birdman is always trying to get in Keaton\\'s head. Anyway, Keaton decides he\\'s gonna rehash an old story on Broadway as a last resort all the while juggling being broke, his daughter/assistant/former rehabbed, an uncooperative yet skilled actor, an ex-wife and a potential baby mama. Here\\'s where it gets good. The tone of the entire movie just sucks. It\\'s painful and dark and discouraging and gritty. I absolutely loved it. It spoke to me. The acting was awesome. Every detail seemed to reflect on how creating something new is really really hard. Because in order to create something new, you have to keep turning yourself inside out and be real with yourself... Which honestly, is a really dark place to arrive at sometimes. So obviously Keaton was there. He was in that dark place where he had nothing left but himself and his feelings and it was all on the line. Everything depended on this play. Now to go into a little more detail on how Keaton attained his entitled attitude - Apparently some tough critic gave him an encouraging note on a cocktail napkin after a performance earlier in his life and he got cocky and hit it big with Birdman which only taught him that he didn\\'t have to work hard for anything. Later on he discovered the critic really doesn\\'t give a crap about him or his lousy arrogant pompous ambitions to direct and star in his play. Oh I forgot to mention by the way... In the play, he\\'s a deadbeat who gets cheated on and shoots himself dead. Now during the whole movie it seems that the play (getting darker and darker each preview performance) intentionally reflects Keaton\\'s life as a failure so you\\'re kind of being led to anticipate his fate unravel as a viewer.Somewhere in the middle of the film, Keaton succumbs to Birdman who convinces him that he is better than everyone else and all he needs is Birdman to be successful. He then becomes deranged and fantasizes about flying around the city like superman. Now the important thing to mention here is that the whole tone in this scene is mockery as I understood it. NOT wonder and excitement. Cheesy mockery of the terrible mega blockbusters filled with the cheap thrills aka Transformers, Avengers and so on and so forth. This to me was portraying a false reality. An escape from his pain that would last so long until leading him to his certain death (just like the play)So here is where the film had led me. Keaton had two choices. Listen to Birdman and stay a cocky delusional low life prick, or accept his valley and work to the bones to get out. So of course he continued to partake in Birdman\\'s flighty fantasies so obviously he was going to die right? At the premier of his show, Keaton was faced with being more genuine with his acting so he decides to use a real gun at the ending suicide scene. Now I realize that he looked and saw that the gun was loaded so I said to myself, yes he will finally accept the fate he has chosen. Come to find out, he wakes up famous with a nose job. He\\'d become a spectacle because he shot his nose off... And succeeded? This is where the movie really let me down. The whole movie was all about not caring what people think and not becoming a YouTube hit or a spectacle. And yet, this was the ending... He became famous for such an \"artistic\" sacrifice. The movie was supposed to be about the heart of the aching city. Not some celebrity who shoots his nose off for attention and flies out his hospital window while his daughter giggles at the sight of it. The strong and true lesson is this. Hard work is unseen much but highly recognized for lifetimes. A celebrity is a temporary spectacle.Unfortunately it seems as if Birdman is just as ignorant as it claims to be.',\n",
              " 'In the past entries the most interesting characters in the movie were Magneto and Xavier.

There are also good old \"previously on X-Men\" scenes that have to fill the gaps between totally stupid conversations and another dull huge CGI scene. Final cheap trick is of course making fun of the Christian belief system. It seems to me as it is a way to gain popularity and climb out from the deep whole that director and producer dumped the movie in to. Polish accent was so...Stupid. Seriously. Scenes that supposed to be emotional were simply funny as Fasbender did not learned even one word properly and Polish \"actors\" were literally reading from the cart board. It seriously ruined every single scene in that segment including the final one. This is by far the weakest X-Men movie made to date. It\\'s little like Hobbit.

I could go on and on about how they had made every detail spot on from the depiction of Asgard to the All Father. What I like to touch on and thought that they had executed brilliantly was the simplicity of the story line. It allowed for the characters to breathe and grow. Where most of Marvel\\'s superhero movies basically is like watching a WWF match. Pretty much staged and dramatised action. In Thor, although you do get action, it played a supporting role to the story line. The whole movie revolved around siblings who just want to impress their father. The fact that anyone could be pushed to the brink just to see the glimmer of acceptance and pride in the eyes of the people that they love, can be related to just about everybody. The emotional journey from a brother who realised what his ignorance has cost him to a brother who struggles to stand alone and be accepted and appreciate, all was played perfectly by Chris Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleston. Nothing but praise in that department. Probably one of the most emotional and heartbreaking line:\"I could have done it father. For you, for all of us.\"What came next left me in pieces. The quote symbolises an ending, a beginning and practically sums up the entire movie and character. And it was the line that launched a mighty fandom. Overall, the movie to me scored high marks all around from the visuals, story line and acting to even the score which I must say was one of the best movie scores I have heard in a while. Well done to Patrick Doyle! It brought all the emotions out and evidently lifted the movie to a whole new level.',\n",
              " \"Full Metal Jacket's thematic exploration on the duality of man is not buried in the slightest...in one moment Joker (aptly named) even jests about the origin of his 'born to kill' slogan on his helmet and his inevitability at getting his hands stained with blood with war coming. This is not really actual engagement but rather Kubrick being witty. Suffice to say that most wars could end up going down the 'war is hell' pathway where there are no clear moral boundaries and fresh-faced young men are thrust into a chaotic, nightmarish world to cope. In Full Metal Jacket Kubrick has done the same as what Stone did in Platoon; obscure the surroundings in smoke, ash and explosions, give no sense of direction or control, and drop the inexperienced squadron right into the middle of it. Here, they have no idea who or what is shooting at them half the time, and it is terrifying and disorientating, and the film begins to close in on them and their paranoia rather than have it be an external battle. The frenzy of war also reflects the stylistic shift that Kubrick has created here. First the rigid geometry of the boot camp, the long rows of bunk beds, the spotless surfaces, the coldly-lit corridors that allow for no non-conformity. And then the smoky, shaky battlefields where all sense of purpose and direction is lost. It is no wonder that so many viewers have found the first half of the film so riveting and yet cannot engage with the second half after the soldiers are dropped in hell. But is the raw and senseless portrayal of war really saying as much as it thinks it is? Many war films making the same bait and switch have long relied on the audience expectations, in particularly those who have never been so much as near a battlefield, of it being a precise and action-packed affair, especially with the less serious films paving the way for masculine, adrenaline-filled heroics and balls of fire. But the other extreme is also a bit nonsensical; there is only so much chaos and disorganisation and bodies flying that you can really throw at the screen until the message because senseless. It cannot at any point be an actual substitute for substance, an argument for the listlessness and meaningless experiences of these youths. Apocalypse Now was another film that went along the same lines, but found itself confused and with little to say at the end. But even that had a certain warping of the mind, of the physical and mental being muddled until we knew neither how long nor how far the crew had sailed up river. Here, the scenes are not part of a descent or a journey, but individually compartmentalised. If anything the vividness of the opening boot camp is an anti-climax. It promises the harshness and physicality and broken mentality of the battles to come, and then takes a little detour, if only to give that final extended sequence a little extra punch. Dishonesty is not something that Kubrick would normally be accused of. But here it is, flashy and in our face; Lee Ermey from a low-angle shot, seducing and making the audience clamour for more, and then overshadowing the rest of the film. Gomer Pyle's fate is perhaps a little less impactful than it might have been in 1987. Back then it was edgy and serious - today these menacing, open- mouthed snarls, the zoom-ins to the dead eyes, the loving whispers to the rifle and the adoration of Whitman and Oswald have all been seen before, so their shock lessens considerably. It is not all lost, simply because Vincent D'Onofrio is excellent. When smirks at his first confrontation with Hartman, and we really believe that he is trying to hide is smirk, but all the same we smirk with him. Kubrick has something to say about violence, and how it is not all that it is chalked up to be. But when Pyle takes a shot at his drill instructor and finally finds satisfaction, the bullet piercing his chest is in slow-motion, and over-dramatised. Later he constructs an elaborate set-piece involving two sets of camera crews, and makes a pointed note at the artificiality of the Vietnam battlefield, but has not realised he has contradicted himself. He has also walked right into a massive oversimplification - it seems the world of Vietnam is separated thinly by two archetypes of solider. One is the blatantly racist and juvenile meat-head like Animal Mother and co., as seen by the martial arts routine of the camera thief, the way they massacre civilians out of a helicopter like a video- game, and the approach towards the prostitute (a funny irony as they later get terrorised by a little girl wielding a machine gun). The other is the saint within a hellhole, Joker as the solitary moralist who does not want to wade into waters until he is too far gone. Kubrick wants to make his inevitable fall agonising, but even that isn't a irredeemable act, but rather a compromise - he is mercy killing the girl to prevent further pain. In one moment a soldier simply steps on a landmine and is blown up. There is no droning of the soundtrack, only silence, and the life is taken from us just like that. But Kubrick is more content to smother the film in the plastic ironies of upbeat pop songs over senseless violence. The squadron marches along soullessly to the tune of Mickey Mouse, but we already knew the tone their lives would take.\",\n",

To say you have to suspend disbelief watching The Next Three Days is no misunderstatement, mainly because you really can't see or understand what's going on for most of the film, even though nothing much happens for the first 90 minutes.Pittsburgh, Pa. cops bust into the middle class suburban Crow home, Gestapo fashion, to arrest his wife for murder.Years later she's still in jail and you wonder where the time went, yet the film is still in its early stages...it lasts more than two hours in total.After exhausting all legal appeals Crow decides to bust his wife out of jail....and there I became lost because he seemed lost, which obviously was the director;s intent, to show a desperate man searching for a solution. But this didn't transfer to the screen well. Insteas Crow seemed to be sleepwalking the tedious planning stages, mostly in the sort of noir darkness we see in some super hero films such as the Dark Knight.Yet, we never really see the plan because it becomes sort of an ad hock escape attempt.But, for me the real corker was when the cops get involved...total trite worn-out contrivance from start to finish.What took you two hours to witness, the cops solve in a few minutes. In the end you are left with asking why you wasted so much time, and money if you took a date to see the Next Three Days.Another major flaw with the film, as I mentioned, was its length...a max of 90 minutes would have been better for a film with so little actual substance.\",\n",

For the most part, the plot was really plot less and the singing for the most part was awful. Again, It was a waste of money to see. Was that really them themselves singing? Pierce Brosnan is good to look at but his singing was terrible. If I had a fast forward button, I would have used it through most of this film. I don't think there was any part of it that was worth wanting to see ever again. I do not want to own a disk of this either. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone to see unless they want total boredom.

This is not a piece to just entertain, the creator has put his own feeling and I believe life experience and the fear always buried in children\\'s mind into it. It is a comely tale that express the creator\\'s thoughts in some way, whilst shining as a attractive animation piece with so many details that you might have ignore if you were careless. It is a rich story and I can see the efforts creators put into it in many spots and frames.e.g. While Chihiro was walking towards the garden where Haku told her to meet him, she passed some stairs where she can see an island, there are some house on it, she stopped for it for a little while, that, represents her longing to human world, her own world, this kind of details can be ignored by many people but they don\\'t mind putting it in to make the whole story richer, more truthful, full of power of humanity.Apart from that, did you ever notice that some \"camera language\" was used very well to tell the story in a more entertaining and better pace.e.g. When Kamaji was telling Chihiro how Haku turned up to this world before just like what she did, the \"camera\" panned to where the little rat(changed from the fat baby)was showing off to soots by putting his foot into the spell melted print while Kamaji\\'s introduction about Haku\\'s background is also getting across to the audience. This is just one of the details that shows how much story telling skills and rhythm control of plots.There\\'re many other things like this, shouldn\\'t be ignored if you want to make a nice comment, even though as an American viewer you might miss a lot of the story by lack of the culture background, but that\\'s not the reason that you can comment it as anyway you want without even really READ the film.I am a visual effects person and film maker but I can\\'t tell where the jerking of the footage and the stopping of character\\'s movement are in the film. could Gazzer please enlighten us? As also a fan of Pixar I hope I don\\'t have bias on either American animations or Japanese ones, but as a Chinese who might have some resistance towards Japanese products for national esteem or historic reason, I still admires Ghibli Studio\\'s work. \"Spirited Away\" is a masterpiece of elegant picture and touching story, if Gazzer-2 knows what that means.\"Ice Age\" was a pretty cute one of Fox productions, but not good enough to compete with \"Spirited Away\" I\\'m afraid. And I\\'d laugh at the opinion that the story of \"Ice Age\" is much simpler hence Oscar committee didn\\'t recognise it, actually I believe \"Spirited Away\" was beautifully hand-painted frame by frame while \"Ice Age\" had a giant crew in 3d animation and visual effects. I\\'m afraid Ice Age was the much more complicated one.',\n",

I wasn't aware it would take 2.5 hours to see that. Then that long stagecoach ride that never ended, the funniest part in that scene was watching Daisy Domergue cop a hook to the face. I knew I was loosing interest when I started picking up my phone checking Facebook. The scene at the end where there's 10 minutes of hell was great, watching a face get shot off was a pick me up, but overall I wont watch it again.\",\n",

Bogdanovich does a nice job of evoking 1930s Midwest, helped greatly by Kovacs' authentic-looking black and white cinematography. The film ultimately proves less than satisfying because of a weak, episodic script that is a bit too contrived and tends to wander somewhat aimlessly. The episodes, particularly those dealing with Kahn as a prostitute and Hillerman as a bootlegger, are not compelling enough to pass for more than mild entertainment.

O Brother, Where Art Thou is one of the 15 movies I own simply because of how effective I found it.

Suffering from the same disease as The Matrix, three very good movies could have been made from ideas in Fight Club.

When we first took notice of this up and coming thespian, we saw him evolve from a good-looking young teen in many of his Early Disney\\'s films, to his first adult roles. Many critics believed and still do, he never did grow out of his early cocoon characters and thus do not take Russell seriously. I and many of his loyal fans disagree. He is a remarkable individual who does well to establish his own mature persona in many landmark films like \"Escape From New York and \"Soldier.\" In this current offering, \"Death Proof\" Russell plays \\'Stuntman Mike\\' a cool, calculating, but extremely diabolical character who seems gratified to seek out, temporally engage, then destroy beautiful, unsuspecting women, just for the fun of it. Throughout the film, one wonders \"WHY\" as no real reason is ever given. The director ( Quentin Tarantino ) is much like his film persona as he lets\\' Mike all but dominate the action-packed film only to reverse all that he created. A first for Russell as we see what forty years of movie roles have done to this once great actor at the hands of directors.

We had a group of five, all ardent filmgoers, ages 12 to 80, and it was an unanimous verdict - sort of interesting in the 3D presentation, but a terrible story. Scorcese basically lectures the audience on the value of film preservation. If that's not a yawner from the get-go, I don't know what is. He includes scenes from historically-important films, either replicating them directly, or paying homage to them. When he tried the Harrold Lloyd clock scene, I could only think of how inferior it was to the original; no suspense, no humor, just waiting for the scene to end. Then he must have done that train coming into the station four or five times. Okay, you don't need to sledgehammer everyone. And why did everyone in Paris have an English accent? Quite strange. There was nothing subtle, nothing surprising, nothing beyond clich√© in the story. To top it off, we had to pay extra for the 3D. I would have liked the money back on this one.\",\n",

'IT' was not a horror film.I may as well have been watching The Goonies/Stand By Me/Stranger Things. Certain songs in the soundtrack really did not fit the scenes. The Score was just WAY TOO MAGICAL for a horror movie. Scenes would have benefited from no music at all i.e. Father/Daughter scene in the house. This would have given the movie a gripping sense of realism which I just could not find ANYWHERE.I could not get attached to the characters in this film as they just kept attaching themselves to the party like leeches. How many characters are there in the end? 7 or 8? Way too many. The acting was okay. The kid with the glasses didn't really fit the 'Obnoxious bad boy' role and ended up just being annoying where the chubby kid looked literally 3 years younger than the main girl...They were meant to be in the same class weren't they? The main bully was probably the scariest character in the entire film including the clown but I will get to that in a minute. The main bully was literally a psychopath! Who is not scared of a psychopath? I mean, the part where he used the switchblade to carve his name into the chubby kids stomach and the chase scene which ensues was a highlight of the 'horror' film. This was one of the more realistic scenes. It's way over the top, but was one of the very few sadistic horror aspects of this film. The kids were also way too brave and ultimately very quickly ended up not being afraid of the clown at all.I'll keep it short and sharp with the clown. It's voice was not even the least bit scary throughout the film. Yes there were semi unnerving scenes, i.e. the drain scene at the start where the clown was talking to the boy. This was more of what I wanted to see as a horror fan, it's creepy demeanor and sick tendencies/intentions though speech alone. However this was then followed by a ridiculous scene where it shows a bunch of razor sharp teeth and proceeds to bite the boys hand then cutting to the whole arm missing. Really?I often caught myself throwing my hands up in the air in disbelief and thinking to myself, How did this get classed as a horror movie.We ended up walking out early as we just couldn't take it anymore.

This gripping \\'lost child\\' drama, cutting through the layers of lower-income South Boston, displays amazing sensitivity, and Oscar-caliber performances by a top-notch cast.Adapted from Boston novelist Dennis Lehane\\'s best-selling novel, the film unapologetically views a neighborhood crushed by poverty, alcoholism, and drug addition, yet clinging to a stubborn pride. When a little girl disappears, the child\\'s aunt (Amy Madigan), frustrated by the slow progress of dedicated cop Morgan Freeman, hires local detective team Casey Affleck (Ben\\'s brother) and Michelle Monaghan to join in the search. Despite only cursory assistance from the detectives handling the case (Ed Harris and John Ashton), Affleck discovers a web of lies and deceit, starting with the child\\'s drug addict mother (Oscar-nominated Amy Ryan). As the layers of deception unravel, questions of integrity and \\'best interest\\' are raised, lifting the film far above a simple detective story! In many ways, Affleck\\'s \\'Patrick Kenzie\\' is a descendant of film detectives of the past, from Sam Spade and Phillip Marlowe, to Lew Harper; a man with a code of honor and unshakable integrity, hidden beneath a flippant exterior, facing a world where morality and truth are colored in shades of gray. It is a nearly impossible situation, and Casey Affleck is extraordinary in the role, capturing the anguish of a man whose virtues might destroy any hope of happiness. Equally good are Monaghan, combining beauty, stability, and humanity, and Harris, whose true character unfolds gradually, in a remarkable acting tour-de-force.Ben Affleck\\'s compassion and deep devotion to the people of the grittier side of Boston makes him an ideal storyteller, and provides an authenticity to each scene that only a \\'native\\' could provide. This certainly doesn\\'t \\'feel\\' like the first production of a novice filmmaker...Bravo, Ben!',\n",

Another seeding of my impressions of what SH should look and act like are of course the Granada television series starring the late Jeremy Brett. Everyone does different things with the characters and adapting the stories, and Ritchie's interpretation-- along with some decent acting-- are quite valid and within plausibility of the legendary yet fictional character's representation.In fact, aside from being initially dismayed at (untrue) reports of anachronistic or non-canonical fighting scenes, the only things which made me wonder why the movie dared to include something which I didn't see fit, was that I hadn't read the SH story which might have explained or justified the inclusion!The film was enjoyable and had a mystery to be solved, a few false leads to make it unpredictable, excellent cinematography and direction, crackling dialogue, a great transformation in portrayal as seen by Eddie Marsan and even Jude Law's mustache, seemingly authentic costuming, and a better use of Watson than as a dopey version of Ed McMahon (as we're used to seeing) or as a device to convey exposition to the audience-- which was done in another way.Very well-crafted action movie with a cerebral, literary, and historical edge.

              " 'I\\'ve seen a lot of horror movies, one\\'s that are real, one\\'s that are supernatural. Old, new, gory, intelligent, but usually you can\\'t get that mix in a horror film and have it come out as a masterpiece. Martyrs broke the mold and took all my doubts away. No film since The Exorcist and Jaws has had such intelligence, style, great script, relatable characters and shock value that had all that and worked. We\\'ve had a few that come close but nothing as to what I just witnessed with Martyrs. I heard a little bit about this film in 2010 and read about it in an article. The plot seemed kind of confusing from the way the author wrote about it, so I decided to wait on seeing it. I have never been so disappointed with myself when it came to deciding to wait on a film. I saw this film 4 days ago and still, I\\'m shaking and can\\'t get it out of my head. Not to say that everyone will have this experience, but Martyrs is a masterpiece of horror cinema that I\\'ve been waiting for.A young girl, Lucie, escapes from a factory where she has been imprisoned and physically abused for a lengthy period of time. Lucie is placed in an orphanage, where she is befriended by a young girl named Anna. Anna soon discovers that Lucie believes that she is constantly being terrorized by a ghoulish creature; a horrible, disfigured, emaciated woman. Fifteen years later, Lucie bursts into a seemingly normal family\\'s home and kills them all with a shotgun. Lucie calls Anna to tell her that she has finally found and killed the people responsible for her childhood abuse. Upon arriving, Anna is horrified at the carnage, and worries that Lucie may have murdered the wrong people. But after a vicious attack on Lucie from her \"ghost\", who turns out was a victim who she left before she escaped the factory when she was a child, Anna finds out that maybe Lucie wasn\\'t wrong and things take a turn from worse to the ultimate Hell.When the films Saw and Hostel were released, they were dubbed as \"too hard to handle\" and given the new genre of \"torture porn\", I hate that term by way. Those films are a walk in the park compared to a lot of movies that I\\'ve seen to be honest. A lot of people are categorizing Martyrs in the torture porn genre and it\\'s ticking me off. Saw and Hostel use the gore and violence as the plot devices, Martyrs doesn\\'t use the violence as a way to just make the audience squirm, but instead you\\'re taken into this dark world that you don\\'t want to ever be apart of. The performances are just magnificent, especially to Myl√®ne Jampano√Ø who plays Lucie. Morjana Alaoui plays Anna and pulls in a heart wrenching performance. The direction, the lighting, the sets, the script, I couldn\\'t find any flaws that are not nitpicking.I literally feel like I\\'ve been strangled with this film, it actually made me cry. It was so much deeper than what I was expecting. I\\'m about to give away the ending, so please don\\'t read on because no one should know what is going to happen if they haven\\'t seen this film yet. First off when Anna is tortured, it\\'s unbearable to watch her go through this for days, she\\'s force fed some weird unknown food that looks like gruel. Then some giant man comes in and just beats her nearly to death. When she\\'s \"reached the final stage\", which is surprising to the people who are doing this to her, they skin her alive. She \"lets go\" and comes back and you find out that the people who did this to her and the others do this because they want to know what happens after death. So Anna dies, but comes back and tells the leader, Mademoiselle what she saw, but in a whisper so the audience can\\'t hear. The society comes to the house excited to hear what is beyond death and when asked by a member outside Mademoiselle\\'s locked door she simply replies \"keep doubting\" and shoots herself. Couldn\\'t have been a more perfect ending, because what happens after death should remain a mystery as everyone has their own interpretation. Martyrs is much deeper than I expected, I underestimated this film and now it\\'s one of the best horror movies I have ever seen in my life. As to the remake that is now supposedly in the green light now, please see this movie first, because I give a lot of remakes a chance, but this one already is looking really bad since it was bought by the producers of Twilight. Martyrs should be respected and is a true masterpiece.10/10',\n",

These are key to understanding the plot and the motivations and mind-set of Leonard. I didn't have any difficulty in this area, perhaps because I am described as observant and attentive. By the time the third shift happened, I was ready for it, and by the end of the movie, was relishing each shift. In case its not obvious, if you can't handle these shifts, you will not do well in understanding the movie. :End SideNoteLeonard can't fix his life. He asserts that he is seeking revenge for his wife's murder, but that is a smokescreen to him dealing with the person he's become, and the life he's living. He can't let go of the notion that his wife is just around the corner, 'just gone to the bathroom'. This haunts him. If he could just wake up one day knowing that his wife was gone, he could let go. He destroys evidence and kills people, but when he wakes up, his purpose in life will still be to find John G., as tatooed on his body.The uncomfortable truth uncovered through Leonard is the limitations, frailties, and desperation we all contain. Leonard's memory problem sets the backdrop, and his dealing with it is where you will start questioning things. While you can mentally seperate yourself from the character in the beginning because you don't share his particular ailment, in relection you will see the connections to all people.My reaction to Leonard's character changed with my changing perception of his motivations, as well as how conscious he was of his actions. Victim? Murderer? Confused and desperate? Its all there.I enjoyed Memento, and I intend to watch this movie again. There are many levels here, and I want to pick up on more. I saw the DVD on the small screen. Included is an interview with the director, which carried some interest. Unfortunately, the interviewer didn't seem to fully understand the movie, which weakened it somewhat.\",\n",

He got himself Oscar nominations and was considered to direct Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone. His next project was Unbreakable which did fairly well critically, but not so successful at the box-office. His follow-up was Signs, which won critically acclaim, and is a film I like, but has split film fans into lovers and haters. After all that Shyamalan started going down. His next film The Village was not so successful, critically or commercially, before really loosing the plot when making Lady in the Water and The Happening.The Village is set in a small rural community at the turn of the century. It is run by a good of village elders, including Edward Walker (William Hurt), Alice Hunt (Sigourney Weaver) and August Nicholson (Brendan Gleeson). It seems to function like early colonial towns in America, with town meetings to decide issues. However, this is no ordinary town: in the woods are strange creatures that could attack the village. Anything red is bury because it's considered the bad colour, whilst yellow is the colour of protection. There is a truce between the village and the creature, but something ends up attacking and killing some animals. One of the younger members of the community, Lucius Hunt (Joaquin Phoenix) offers to risk his life to get medicine from the nearest town. He would have to walk through the forest to do this. He believes that the creatures wouldn't attack him because of his noble intentions. But the elders refuse. Lucius also rekindles his friendship with Ivy Walker (Bryce Dallas Howard), a blind woman and daughter of Edward. They start to fall for each other and end up getting engaged. However, Lucius gets stabbed, and Ivy ends up having to leave the village to get medicine for him.The Village was marketed as an interesting horror film, but has a was really a film about social control. The social control idea by itself is interesting, but the way it was handle should have been a lot better. I think it would have made a better film as a proper horror film in a period settling. It could have been very scary and effective with a proper fresh twist. But Shyamalan did not do this. Shyamalan is a director who is famous for having a twist in his films. I don't mind that, but if you see that ended up trying to make a more grounded film at the end it ends up making the film fall of plot holes. This twist doesn't work like it did with the Sixth Sense. The writing is the problem, but Shyamalan's direction is decent. He's not perfect but there are some good shots in the film.The film's main strength is the cast. Bryce Dallas Howard has a strong debut and is a pretty interesting character. Joaquin Phoenix and Adrian Brody are both normally good in their films and they don't break that trend here. William Hurt was a little hit and miss, but he does have a really good moment when arguing with the Elders. However Sigourney Weaver offers a weak performance compared to what she usually does, and Brendan Gleeson's (who I normally like) character may as well not have been in the film.There are some interesting ideas and decent scenes, but it should have been a lot better.\",\n",
              " 'I am a huge fan of both the original books, and the Swedish movies, but this movie is a major improvement on the Swedish movie. Essentially, the books could be used as movie scripts, with little done to alter them, and this movie pretty much does that. My biggest complaint is that Lisbeth appears to be wearing \"gang pants\" instead of Goth pants throughout the movie. I don\\'t see her wearing pants with the crotch around her mid-thighs, as that would restrict her movement too much, and she is more likely to be wearing skin-tight pants.They did a good job with the denouement at the end, with Hans Erik Wennerstrom, and also the concluding segment is excellently done. Overall, I was skeptical going in about this movie, and came out excited about seeing the remaining two movies. The original Swedish movies are not nearly as good as they could be on Girl Who Played with Fire and Girl Who Kicked the Hornets\\' Nest. They portrayed the Millennium staff as a bunch of gutless wimps, when in the books, they were journalists like Steig Larsson, willing to risk their lives to get the truth out to the public! I hope that these productions will stay true to the books on this!',\n",

Afterwards my WHOLE life changed. The movie it self is about in my opinion letting go. About a lonely everyday guy with a good condo. Wishing something bigger would happen in his life. Then to answer his prayers he meets a man on a plane ride named Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt). Who is exactly who the Narrator (Edward Norton) wants to be. One night they get together and start fighting and releasing pent up aggression and then the story only escalates into the story of hte Narrator losing control of his life and this movie in a nut shell follows the Narrator through this dark period in his life. The acting is absolutely superb Tyler is the man everyone of us wants to be he is absolutely crazy and we eat it up. Edward Nortons best movie in my opinion as hte Narrator even better then America History X. He plays the perfect depressed insomniac. And this movie is absolutely mind blowing. You could consider the movie to be the venture spiraling downward into ruining the narrators life or you could consider it his rebirth. This movie speaks on everything and this is really a movie you have to watch multiple times to really \"get\" it.Trust me its a lot funnier the second time you watch it. This movie also has many things to say about society today and how pointless are existence it. The fight club sequences are done masterfully these fighting ant pretty they\\'re not stylized with Kung Fu or martial arts its an all out brawl crazy testosterone pumping. This movie really appealed to me because its about letting go I live a very similar life to the Narrator before he meets Tyler. This movie deserves higher on the top 250 list. Especially if you were born in this nineties MTV computer generation. This movie is impossible to pass up. I encourage every person to see this it appeals to all genres action comedy drama crime everything.',\n",
              " \"1st watched 10/28/2001 - 9 out of 10(Dir-Alfred Hitchcock): *Spoilers*Classic Hitchcock thriller with excellent performances by Jimmie Stewart and Kim Novak. This movie is a unique experience to watch because as a viewer you are in Stewart's shoes until the reality of the situation is revealed to you by Hitchcock and of course Stewart is the kind of star that we're always routing for(so we're hoping for the best till the very end). Guess what? We don't exactly get what we're hoping for, and that's what makes this is a special film in my eyes. It goes against the grain by putting likeable characters who actually don't come out on the good side. This makes for a horrible viewing experience in some people's eyes, but to me it throws a twist into what should be expected from these viewing experiences(Now when I see Jimmie Stewart, I don't always expect him to get the girl -- in a way). The movie is technically well done as well with even some animation thrown in for a dream sequence. All in all I believe this is one of the (if not the best) Hitchcock movie which has influenced many future movies by other directors and will probably continue to influence more. Bravo!!\",\n",

              " \"Raging Bull - a movie about a man with bad problems. What kind of problems... Well a lot. I was disturbed when I watched this, this beautiful cinematic experience. The opening, the distance, De Niro dancing in the ring with a leopard robe, black and white, ohh.... The best cinematography, it is something very VERY beautiful. Words can't express how far my love for this movie has gone and is going. I will give it a second watch...With all that said, I think you'll know just how much I like Raging Bull. So, Raging Bull is about Jake LaMotta, the most mentally complex protagonist ever. A man who is number #1 in boxing, he is in his eyes at the top of the world. While he is at the top of the world, everything he does and stands for outside the ring get's completely mauled. My most interesting analysis is Jake's psychology. Does he suffer from some mental dis- order? Or is this man seriously just like this naturally? His name is so accurate, he truly is a bull. A raging one. He does so many things that I think are just crazy. His sexual jealousy, his anger, every inch of detail he looks at, what the hell is wrong with him? I hated him, and that is a good thing. This character of Jake is the most mental wise evil protagonist I have seen so far. This movie had some psychological thriller in it. And what can I say about the black and white cinematography? I loved it so much! It made the movie even darker. This movie is a masterpiece you need to watch, the best movie that has boxing in it, and just all around one of the smartest movies I have ever watched.\",\n",
              " 'Everybody knows Scorsese is a terrific director. After all, \"Taxi Driver\" and \"Goodfellas\" are certainly two of the best movies ever.But I¬¥m sorry to say that this time he just blew it! This movie, in my opinion, is a waste of perfectly good celluloid! Here are the reasons why I think this film sucks: 1) Too long ! I don¬¥t know what happened, but perhaps Mr. Scorsese got a little carried away when shooting \"the movie that he always wanted to shoot\". Result: very boring 2 hours and 40 minutes, when this film could have been done in just 2 hours. \"LOTR\" was fine, but \"Gangs\" lacks the storyline for a movie with such length. 2) Leo Di Caprio. His acting is so inexpressive, he could have been replaced for a cardboard dummy of himself. I just couldn¬¥t find other feelings for his character other than boredom. Amsterdam is clearly the \"hero\" of this movie, but he just hasn¬¥t got the guts to be one. Oh, his \"accent\" just SUCKS big time. 3) Weak plot. Yeh, yeh, yeh: my dad just got killed by his nemesis, so I¬¥ll have my revenge when I grow old.First:I¬¥ll get close to him. Second: I¬¥ll gain his confidence. Third and main part:if everything works out, PAYBACK TIME ! Oh man, didn¬¥t I heard it all before somewhere ? 4) Lots of continuity mistakes. Per example: the part where Amsterdam makes a toast to Bill the butcher, his glass is half-filled with wine.Next shot: his glass is EMPTY !! Next shot: FULL AGAIN ! Whoa, those guys can drink REALLY fast, huh ? And what about the extras STARING at the camera at that first battle (natives X dead rabbits)? DUHHHHH ! 5) Cameron Diaz. I think that she¬¥s in this film just because of her (great)looks, because her character just doesn¬¥t matter to the storyline. Picture this movie without her. Any changes? Not for me. This film isn¬¥t good. But let¬¥s face it: Daniel Day-Lewis saves the day here. His acting is superb. In my opinion, Bill the butcher is the main character of this film, instead of Amsterdam \"Look-my face is glued\" Vallon. And the photography, soundtrack, costumes and everything technical was great. But if technical stuff really made movies good, XXX would have gotten the Oscar for best film. My grade for \"Gangs\": (4/10)',\n",
              " \"Really, Scorsese should just give it away for anyone. The man is one of the most brilliant directors of our time. Anyway, let me get to the actual movie; I just saw it at a early screening and have to write this while I'm thinking about how stunning it was. Shutter Island is certainly not a typical film, not even for Scorsese. It is a different take for the director, and he does it, as he does every film, perfectly, so much as to be in his own league of film-making. I don't want to give anything away, but I will say this: Shutter Island was completely unexpected, and a great start to 2010. It had all the components of a great film, and then some. The acting is spot on from every character; none of it seems forged or out of place. The script is fantastic; it has one of the most intriguing plots I have seen in a while (exception being Tarantino's Basterds). Everything, down to the set's lighting, was perfectly executed. I will say that not everyone will like this; Shutter Island, again, isn't your typical movie. To those, though, who do choose to see this film, be ready for a compelling, gripping, thought-provoking experience, so much so that you might think to see it again for further clarity (I know I will; it was so entertaining and my mind was blown!). Don't be surprised if you see this at the next Oscars... a must watch for everyone\",\n",

              " 'Life of Pi is an absolutely outstanding philosophical film, undoubtedly one of the best to come out last year. It recently won four Academy Awards, all of which were absolutely deserved; it is impeccably crafted and deeply moving. The first time I saw the film, the framing narrative structure disoriented me, due in large part to the deliberate pacing. After watching the movie again, however, everything clicked for me, and now I can say that there is hardly a false note among the storytelling. As an adult, the title character reflects back on his life, how it all changed him, and more importantly, how he still feels about it. We first meet the younger Pi in his school days, and we witness him acquire valuable skills from his family that will ultimately prove highly beneficial in his life, despite the fact that he takes much of it for granted. He also manages to create a new identity for himself, by taking the nickname of \"Pi\" and displaying his knowledge with the irrational number. This ties into much of Pi\\'s overall philosophy; reality hardly matters. What\\'s more exciting and engaging for him and his life is the overall better story. He is first and foremost a storyteller, and he is absolutely one who uses his power wisely. And so it is no wonder that he becomes so intrigued by three various, almost contradictory, religions. He deeply loves the sense of community he gains from them, and he deeply relishes in his faith. Starting with the stunning shipwreck sequence, however, he comes to realize that his faith must continuously be tested in order to be fully pure. And there is surely no stronger test of faith than being stuck in a lifeboat with nothing but an adult Bengal tiger. As time goes on, however, he manages to survive, all the while learning to appreciate the gift of life with what little time he has, and to realize that suffering is a necessity for true happiness. Much debate has been brought about by the film\\'s ending; people wonder \"did it really even happen\"? I personally find the ending extremely powerful, one that enforces the movie\\'s thesis. It hardly matters what really happened at sea in the lifeboat; the only important thing is which story is better. And the jaw-dropping special effects only add to the excitement of the story; this is truly a larger than life experience. Even the use of 3-D is spectacular, as it fully immerses us in Pi\\'s world. This is a technically flawless film, and it begs the question, \"was Avatar ever this visually stunning?\" I\\'d say no. Life of Pi is unquestionably one of the year\\'s best films, and it is more than a film. It is an experience; both a visual one, a philosophical one, and a storytelling one. This film absolutely must be seen; it is an absolute stunner and a near-masterpiece. Overall Rating: 10/10- \"My Highest Recommendation.\"',\n",
              " 'The trend must have been set with the two \"Matrix\"-sequels: take a successful movie and expand it to a trilogy. Each of the sequels must clock in at 3 hours running time and the original simple story must be complicated as much as possible.\"Pirates Of The Caribbean: At World\\'s End\" the latest (final?) entry in the world\\'s most popular franchise is another example of this approach. Sure, even part 1 was structured strangely but it still worked as a movie everyone could understand. After having already forgotten last years \"POTC: Dead Man\\'s Chest\" you\\'ll have a hard time getting into the story in the first place. What are everyone\\'s motives? Why did Captain Sparrow have to die? What\\'s the meaning of the heart in the chest again? Even if you can remember the ongoings of part 2 well, part 3 will give you enough new story lines and plot points to confuse you completely. There are new pirate lord-characters and a previously unheard of goddess called Calypso. Everybody has a different agenda and after a while you have a hard time figuring out who is who, who is where and if things make sense at all.If this wasn\\'t the third part of a well-established and overly promoted franchise it wouldn\\'t have become a success. I doubt that most people could actually follow the storyline, but were merely laughing about the weird antics of Captain Sparrow, a character they have come to love so dearly for his wackiness. That alone is not enough to make a good movie. It\\'s bad entertainment. Other characters like Norrington were underdeveloped and barely got any screen time at all. The romance between Will and Elizabeth was virtually ignored until it was clumsily hammered back into our heads in the final act of the movie. Just another badly established plot point in a weak script.Apart from the fact that \"Pirates Of The Caribbean: At World\\'s End\" is overly intricate it is also unnecessarily drawn out. And hey, that reminds me of the other big blockbuster this year, \"Spider-Man 3\". It has been said before, but it must be said again: Hollywood needs to stop making bad sequel after bad sequel and start showing some originality again. Movies like \"POTC 3\" might make money, but they leave no doubt that right now we are at a new low of American film-making.',\n",

He comes up with the ingenious scheme of having his wife kidnapped for a ransom from his fatherinlaw who is very wealthy and treats his son-in-law as an incompetent. the story takes off from there, twisting and turning in incredible but believable directions, victims dropping like flies. At the core of the movie is pregnant Marge and her painter husband Norm, secure in their domestic bliss. Marge goes out to solve this multiple homicide fiasco, Norm stays home and paints ducks for a postage stamp competition. Some of the scenes are to be seen to be believed and we are shocked out of complacency at times with some pretty graphic violence, and Marge gets her man in the end and does not hesitate to philosophize in the police car at him.

              " \"I admit I didn't care much about this until I heard David Fincher was involved. I loved his work with Fight Club; Se7en; The Social Network; The Game. I liked his story telling with other movies I thought were just OK (Panic Room; Benjamin Button; Zodiac) I was aware there was a book and a first movie, but I didn't know anything about either as to content. I really liked it. The story was interesting, the acting superb, especially Rooney Mara (I will be looking for more from her), the cinematography is excellent, the direction well paced and suspenseful. But, to begin with, the main title sequence seemed out of place. It looks more like the opening of a James Bond movie - weird. Also, and these are dramatic changes, mostly to shorten the film (158 min. is a bit long) I could have done without all the business about Lisbeth's guardian, both the one who has the heart attack and the one who rapes her. I realize it's 'gritty' and is supposed to show how she's abused but fights back, but, I thought the subway scene where her bag is stolen and she fights to get it back did the same thing, only quicker. Actually, I don't know why the whole thing is there - she's a genius hacker - she could just plunder peoples/companies bank accounts - there's no need for her to go asking anyone for money. I think maybe the author had a rape/revenge fantasy he wanted played out. Also, I think it would have been better if she hadn't sexualized her relationship with Mikael, he would have made a better father figure and would have made their relationship more compelling. I think Lisbeth is a fascinating character, I would have liked to have learned more about her and how she lives her daily life and how she became an investigator - maybe that's in the book. I really like the look, atmosphere and pacing of Finchers movies, this is no exception. He is a terrific storyteller. I will always be interested in what he's doing.\",\n",

This is not to say that the film shouldn't do that, no rather I'm arguing that the film needs a bit more of a bridge between this one and the last one. Sue me, for what ever reason I felt like I was reading a book and that some one ripped out two chapters in the middle and that while you can follow what was going on you'd be better off had you read what was missing.That said, I really loved this movie. Packed to the rafters with plots and ideas and action this is the film that the last film should have been. This is a solid 2 hours 45 minutes that never lets up-even as it confuses you. What can I say this film proves what a mistake the last one was and how you really shouldn't take a 90 minute movie and blow it up another hour. But enough complaining about the last film, lets talk about this one.A great thrill ride where characters shift and grow and things move along. I loved it. I loved much of the small stuff-The Bootstap Bill stuff, the broken hearted lovers, the romance and everything else. If there is any real flaw to the film its that the villains-the East India trading company don't really make sense are not menacing enough especially compared to Davy Jones and Captain Barbosa (also some of what they do makes no logical sense whats so ever).

              " 'Gotham Pilot ReviewDC\\'s new TV show Gotham premiered the other night. Gotham chronicles the adventures of a younger James Gordon, before he became commissioner. When I heard about the concept of the show, I doubted that a Gotham City without Batman could ever be interesting or well-conceived.I was accurate in my doubts. I highly suggest watching the Pilot before reading this review, as there will be major spoilers.Overuse of VillainsIn the Pilot alone, Gotham burned through almost six super-villains, most of which were just cameos since Poison Ivy and Cat\"woman\" are both twelve years old. It seems that the Penguin is going to be the major bad-guy in this season. So far his origin story is pretty interesting, but Gotham also introduces a new villain named \"Fish\" that know one has ever heard of. Yay.Honestly, I think the show was quite silly when handling the bad-guys. They obviously want to include some of the big-name baddies like Bane and the Joker, but the reason those villains are so good is because they are approximately the same age as Batman, as well as representing a quality of himself. They just don\\'t really work the same with Gordon.Bruce\\'s Origin SuckedIn the comics and most film adaptations, Bruce Wayne\\'s parents are killed by a random mugger, which sparks Bruce\\'s interest in fighting crime as a whole. In Gotham, the Waynes\\' murder is apparently an organized act, part of a bigger and more dangerous conspiracy. I did not like this change. Bruce does appear in a later scene where he is learning to conquer his fear. It was a cool little piece of foreshadowing.Gordon is a Typical White CopGotham portrayed Jim Gordon as a generic, good, white cop. He is a meat-head, a resourceful and clever one, but a meat-head just the same.It seems that whenever a problem arises, Gordon\\'s first instinct is to think of something clever to say, and then punch the problem in the face.

I came across the fantasy fight scene of a girl against Giant Samurai on Youtube, while searching for some other video. I wanted to see this movie.I was not able to understand the plot or story in the first run. The visuals are stunning. Don't know why it is flopped on Block buster, but it is one of the must watch movie.The girls acted on this movie is fantastic. They do the character very clearly.

The writing is well done and allows the viewer to follow the story while being invested in the characters. It could have been just another mindless action flick, but the actors and the dialogue give it some depth to make it a film worth watching more than once. John Wick (Keanu Reeves), a retired legend in the assassin world, mourns for his dead wife. Her last gift to him is a puppy and a note telling him to love and find peace. It doesn't take long for Iosef Tarasov (Alfie Allen) to mess up John's path to these things. In response, Wick delves back into the criminal world he left behind to seek retribution for Iosef's actions. The story weaves Wick's past life into his present life and reconnects him with old faces including: the female assassin Ms. Perkins (Adrianne Palicki), friend (Willem Dafoe), and former employer Viggo Tarasov (Michael Nyqvist). He faces the difficult task of breaking Viggo's organization to get to the man who took his mourning period away from him, Viggo's son.Put this on, sit back, and expect a film that delivers for the expectations of: action, a simple but tight story, and an enjoyable time.\",\n",

Although the actress that played Search April O'Neil was just horrendous and the worst Search April O'Neil portrayal in the trilogy. The fight sequences was goofy but fun to watch and the chemistry between the turtles and character still works for this one. Shredder didn't seem that much sinister at all this time around until the very end when he gets jacked up on ooze steroids. The bad guys using the ooze to power up the dog and snapping turtle to fight against the Ninja Turtles was a bit lame. But it did make sense to a degree and didn't really take much out of the movie. However the best part was Vanilla Ice rapping a Ninja Turtles rap while the turtles kick butt on the dance floor. Overall this is a good follow up to the first one in my opinion. This installment even has the most in depth connection when it comes to the turtles on where they came from and what their purpose is (no, not that we were all made from a tube of green ooze). Looking back now, it isn't as cool as I thought it was when I was a kid, but it still has enough to make it watchable even today.6.8/10\",\n",

Letters float and I remembered why I wanted to see a 3D movie because I like feeling like I need to move out of the way. But then the movie starts and the film feels like Tim Burton forgot it was 3D until someone said,\"Well that was a terrible take just throw something at the audience and they won\\'t notice.\" But I did So for those of you who have lived under a rock for the past 20 years you grew up watching the Alice in Wonderland animated movie if you didn\\'t rent it at the local video store get those 3D glasses saved from Avatar and you will really enjoy it or go buy the book and throw it across the room.

But the problem comes when we all know the story! Yes it has the Hookah smoking Caterpillar, it has the Cat, and they seemed to have lost the Mad Hatter under Captain Jack Sparrow with a Scottish Accent. But why should you see this pop up book posing as a movie. You shouldn\\'t haven\\'t you read the beginning but if you wanted to here\\'s the story. Alice is 19 and she is about to get married to a character created by Tim Burton on the set of Corpse Bride. His look and domineer is pulled almost spot on from one of the parents in that movie. Alice then sees the rabbit and fallows it down this hole and you know the rest. But the thing is Alice has been here before and the question is why the hell would you want to come back it\\'s such a stupid story with characters created by Tim Burton with cool looks but look like they stepped out of some acid trip you had after reading the book. But they act more like characters for a radio drama. Every actor is flat, boring and almost regretting signing onto this movie and after they read the script and saw how terrible it was they put it into their performance. Maybe because I\\'m not 13 and think Nightmare Before Christmas was the greatest movie ever (and hint, hint Tim Burton did not Direct that TERRIBLE TERRIBLE MOVIE SO QUIT PRASING HIM FOR IT!!!) but Tim Burton acts like a film director but wants to be Robert Smith of The Cure he has the look down all he needs is to die and may be reincarnated as Robert Smith. The whole thing felt like it was half assed the only thing I felt looked good where some of the sets but the CGI was so bad it wasn\\'t believable you could see that people didn\\'t look the same because they where Green Screened in and it looks like it was cut and pasted from some picture you saw on the internet. So far 3D movies haven\\'t sold me the whole thing felt like the main idea was the 3D the acting and the story and even the CGI which should be the most important if you want to put us in a real place. But it all feel behind because the 3D is what mattered most. And it only really hit me it was 3D after the fact someone through something at the screen. Overall it wasn\\'t worth the $10 I spent. I could have spent that on the book then imagined the rest or I could have bought some LSD and had a better time sitting in my room listening to Led Zeppelin I could have done a whole lot more things with that $10. Maybe I should have paid someone to shoot me in the foot sure it would have hurt. But it would be worth it then having to see this boring plain and completely stupidly retarded movie.

The days are long past where FX achievements really *were* achievements that added to the STORY and not the other way around. Spielberg has, with this latest effort, gone way overboard with the FX and lost sight of some things that matter far more like realistic plot-points, for example. We see the son walk over a hill that basically EXPLODES, okay? He should be dead. But no, Steven can\\'t stand to have an unhappy ending to his films, so the son has to return at the end of the movie, having made it to Boston on his own. How do you spell \"pathetic\"? I spell it S-P-I-E-L-B-E-R-G. The daughter probably should have died several times over during the course of the film, also. But Steven can\\'t *allow* that, so we have to endure her histrionic screams at the *END* of the film when she\\'s safely tucked away in a tunnel, while she was a zombie in other scenes just minutes before-hand coming face to face with a whole HOARDE of tripods. Ridiculous continuity! S-T-U-P-I-D. How about the pregnant mom: Steven, are you seriously going to ask me to believe that she didn\\'t go into labor prematurely during this monumental holocaust??? Puhleeeeze!!! Spielberg misses the ferry by shying away from some very logical plot developments and allowing the characters to react to them. How profound would it be to see both your children die and then possibly find your ex-wife near death\\'s door having prematurely lost her stillborn child? This is the stuff that would have made WAR OF THE WORLDS something to cheer about, if Spielberg could have made himself realize the audience needs to be shocked emotionally, not just with FX, and cloying, sappy endings do not adequately resolve two hours of a tortuous film like this. How dare he show me so obviously that a character like the son wants to sacrifice himself in an inferno and then bring him back at the end of the film unharmed? That\\'s just plain insulting and, in a way, sadistic to put an audience through that and then negate the pay-off (that the son is lost -- we have to \"get past that\"). UGGGGHHHH!!!! The passage of time is poorly recorded in this film. How is it that in what seemed like the span of two or three days time so many people could have plastered walls upon walls of \"Missing\" signs as though the onslaught had taken place over a matter of months? Why is it that such a big deal is made out of having to go to the bathroom literally what must have been several days on the run from the tripods? Perhaps the icing on the cake came towards the end when Tom Cruise picks a piece of the alien vegetation off a statue and it crumbles into dust and he has the audacity to conclude, \"They\\'re dying.\" when he is merely a construction worker (NOT A SCIENTIST)! How the hell would he even know enough to GUESS... (yeah, I know, it\\'s the \"wrap up\" so they\\'re trying to get the show over with...). For all this movie\\'s stunning visual effects I couldn\\'t (and can\\'t) get past the stupidity of the script.

Many movie stereotypes were also included in TMRevolutions (huge final battle of good vs evil, someone important dies tha people will supposedly miss, etc.).

You begin with what would actually be the end of the films story line, and then proceed to the beginning of the story line. The film wouldn\\'t be as shocking were it in normal chronological order, and therefore, I believe, would not have received as many good ratings as other users have given it. Aside from being backwards merely to attract more attention to itself, the camera angles will remind you of a strange roller-coaster, often going up, down, left and right. The movie is filmed in a way that the camera is not steady, perhaps also to add to the shock value, and keep viewers in suspense. The keys to the suspense in this film lie not in the story line, but in the filming techniques and order of presentation.

I hoped that movie, however, will bring me up to speed with what was going on in the nonetheless quite exciting sci-fi universe of the title. Unfortunately, this is not what Assassin\\'s Creed (2016) is about. From the very first scene I noticed that Assassin\\'s creed jumps from event to event without caring to explain or give us any background information.

Why do they cut recruit\\'s finger off? Since I played the game, I could try and answer these questions, though the connection between assassins in different countries and eras remained unclear to me anyway. Further on, we see the regional office of Abstergo in Madrid with a lot of people who all behave very strangely, but not in an entertaining way. Even the protagonist reacts to the whole situation by saying: \"What the f*ck is going on here?\", and that was my thought as well. It might have been fun if it all started to make sense in the end. Well, it didn\\'t. Overall I felt some kind of alienation toward the characters. Neither of them got enough screen time and dialogues to reveal their depth. It\\'s even hard to say who are the bad guys here. Is the woman assassin romantically involved with the protagonist? What is Christopher Columbus relationship with the Creed? We don\\'t know. Basically, every time someone shows up, he either fades away quickly or starts running, fighting, etc. I enjoy sword fights and I enjoy fighting like in Chinese action movies, but even this part in Assassin\\'s creed felt off as well. I tried to count, and every hit or throw is shown for no more than 1 second, then camera quickly changes direction and it is very, very hard to follow the action. I just came to acknowledge that there is, in fact, some fighting going on, but I gave up on trying to process it, which is a shame. I think it really should have been a little bit slower-paced, with more thorough acrobatics concentrating on quality of stunts rather than on sheer number of them per second of screen time. Having said all that, it should come as no surprise that plot didn\\'t live up to my expectations. On a personal note, I was disappointed that the movie didn\\'t share a lot with the games (at least to my knowledge) except for the Apple, assassin blade and the Templar-Assassin conflict. Even the Animus looks vastly different. Plot itself is rather simplistic, doesn\\'t give a lot of details and, worst of all, doesn\\'t even try to be complete. The ending is a shameless cliffhanger, despite the fact that I actually felt relieved after the movie had ended. Apparently, Ubisoft wants to launch a new Assassin milk cow in the realm of cinematography in addition to the game series instead of trying to create a classic blockbuster.

Lee accepted the request of Universal studios by walking away from the Terminator 3.rd installment. This makes the movie one of the most anticipated celluloid of 2003.Created by Marvel God Stan Lee the original plot tells the story of a scientist; who transforms in to a monster due to an accident during experiment. But the movie talks about the plot in a more twisted way, dealing with something personal. It takes from the Hero's (Bruce Banner (Eric Bana)) childhood days. His father David Banner (Nick Nolte) being a manic on his experiment finally test his medicine on his own child. By giving some extra antigens which responds to Gamma radiation that Bruce happened to encoder in his matured states, makes him the Most dangerous humanly similar creature ever.. to walk on the planet Earth.Scripted by Michael France, James Schamus and John Turman for the story of James Schamus himself, make the worst movie experience of the life time.Ang Lee consider as a visionary director who did Oscar winning Sense and Sensibility, Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon; totally messed up this plot. The feeling of the studio was that Lee would use his strongly rooted sense of drama to keep The Hulk as character-driven as possible, without allowing the film to digress into a CGI spectacle. Ironically, the studio eventually claimed that there wasn't enough action --not to mention a fan uproar about a rather fake-looking CGI hulk-- and Lee pulled his hair out in frustration over the project.He uses Brian De Palma styles: using split screens in the story telling. I don't know why Lee did that, may be he wanted an art film told in a comic, fast cutting style. What ever he planned, he failed to give a solid rhythm in the screenplay. Also he forgot the main character Hulk by giving more importance to its human side. He forgot that what is Hulk, why everyone calls him Hulk, can he speaks? Yes he speaks in a child, mentally retread type words, but in the movie not a single voice is heard from his mouth. Did Ang Lee plan for a King Kong movie? Also the hulk was such a worst unrealistic CGI work ever happened in any movies. ILM moved their name into worst list.But the worst part beyond that was the actor who played its human side, Mr. Eric Bana. He did a crap work for performing the anger side of the beast. A total miscast in the title role. He really sucked in that role. Eric's face full of dead emotions; a bad actor with dead expressions.While Nick Nolte did a nice work as the feeling father and the twisted scientist in the same time, were Josh Lucas did this film for Money. Only thing good in this movie was Jennifer Connelly as (ex) girlfriend Betty Ross. She is an eye candy in this 3hr boring disaster.Mean time Danny Elfman have the chance to change that 'boring disaster' to 'a disaster' if he provide a good soul for the movie. The Background score was really messed up, I can't believe that it was composed by Elfman. The score was mixed with dull and dry sound adding the vocals of Natacha Atlas to represent the Betsy Ross character; it's hard to figure why a classy male vocalist wasn't employed instead. If you can throw aside the popularity of female vocals for a moment, then it could have been a very effective change to hear a wordless male vocalist represent Banner's emotions. A true fault from Elfman while he offers some adequate action underscore, but throws the project off balance with his selection of styles and instruments.Only thing happened good in this movie was for Terminator Fans. They are Lucky. WHAT would have Happened if Lee done TERMINATOR 3. James Cameron must HAVE KILLED HIM! All in all see Hulk the movie CRAP, if you want to get bored that much.The Hulk = Bad script from a Good plot went to a non-American sucking director.\",\n",

After taking a burglary job he finds only a suit and questions why it is locked up in a vault. Obviously events lead to him eventually becoming \"Ant-Man\" and trying to stop the villain, Yellowsuit.As previously mentioned, The casting of Paul Rudd surprised me. However the script is perfectly suited to his talents, and he delivers a lights out performance. Dr. Hank Pym is played my Michael Douglas, and he delivers another fantastic performance, as a scientist trying to stop technology that he helped to pioneer from being sold to Hydra. Pym\\'s daughter, Hope was cast to be Evangeline Lilly. She delivers a very solid performance in her role. Darren Cross, the villain, is played by Corey Stoll, and again, a lights out performance on him, making his character both crazy and very evil. Lang\\'s \"crew\" is played by Michael Pena, David Dastmalchian, and T.I. and there are moments where they steal the movie, and definitely cause mass laughter.

Sure, he was really funny on SNL and for some reason I loved Talladega Nights, but Anchorman and Step Brothers were both very mediocre in my eyes. As such, fans can simply ignore everything I say from here on in, because while they will certainly enjoy it, The Other Guys was a huge disappointment in my eyes.The film would have worked great if it had ended twenty minutes in, for the first act was indeed hilarious. Featuring Samuel L Jackson and Dwayne Johnson (who really needs to do a real action movie soon) as hotshot cops with Mark Wahlberg and Will Ferrell stuck at their desks, laughs come quite fast at the start. Conversations about land tuna do well to contrast the ludicrous action sequences.However, once Wahlberg and Ferrell hit the streets, the movie loses all momentum. Various one-note jokes are stretched far too thin, such as Ferrell being irresistible to women or Wahlberg being blamed for shooting Derek Jeter, and most of the other laughs are in the trailer. A revelation about Ferrell's past is random enough to get some laughs, but is quickly overused.The actors do little to lift the material. Jackson and Johnson are great, but limited in screen time. Rob Riggle and Damon Wayans Jr also manage to get the lions share of the second half's laughs despite their small roles. Ferrell's role is too inconsistent, playing up the Ferrell-esquire idiot role to be believable as the functioning member of society the rest of the film expects him to be. Wahlberg starts out as a great straight man, but as he joins the lunacy any barometer of sanity is lost. Michael Keaton never sinks low, but the TLC-oriented jokes around his character grow weak.I really can't say much more than that I didn't find The Other Guys that funny. It was a mostly laughless experience with a good opening, loose plot and ludicrous ending, but fans of Ferrell-McKay movies will likely enjoy it. I just can't claim to be part of that group.\",\n",

              " \"It is, as if, George Miller really wanted to prove, that he can still produce the best vehicle chase scenes in a movie. The film moves along, for the most part, at break neck speed, leaving little time for a breather. For those who aren't familiar with the original trilogy, a brief explanation from Max, about himself, starts the film. For any fan of the originals, the way it was executed will of been a disappointment. Max feels less important in this film. His character is not the centre of the story, but more a part of it. Perhaps this is a good thing however. Tom Hardy's version of Max Rockatansky feels more trying. Mel Gibson made that character his own. It was pulled off naturally, without any need to be macho or overtly crazy. Tom Hardy's portrayal looks and sounds more akin to some of his previous efforts, (see 'Bronson').But that was always going to be the inevitable disappointment for fans of the originals, trying to enjoy a new Mad Max with a different actor filling in the shoes of such an iconic character.The film as a whole, wears all the expected fabric of a post apoc' world, but only this time it is worn by a new breed. Theirs plenty to see in this revamped vision, for fans of the old films to enjoy. The insane characters and their surroundings wouldn't look out of place in Road Warrior or Beyond Thunderdome. The pace of the film is very different, and for some part, feels too much, too rushed, like a sugar rush. This was however, Miller's intention. To make a film, that comes at you like a steam train on fire, driven by a load of lunatics.If you treat the original trilogy like a family, then they would all be siblings, born of the same parents; Byron Kennedy (RIP) & George Miller. Fury Road then, feels more like a step brother. Related, but different from the rest.For the younger generation, or just those that have never seen the other three, this new entry, will either introduce them to the original trilogy, or end up being just another action flick.I personally will find it very hard not to stamp my biased opinion on this review, being that the first movie from (1979) is one of my all time favourites. I find Fury Road, without heart. And to me, that was always my connection with the central character 'Max'. Even when he is the burnt out shell of a man, in Road Warrior.Mel Gibson just seemed to own that character. Every little nuance of expression, and he sells it so naturally. The chaotic pace of Fury Road, like a trailer to a modern video game, never gives Hardy the chance to really take over the role and do it justice. Instead we are mainly treated to grunts and scowls. To me, the movie as a whole, is typical of what Hollywood are dishing out. It seems to cater for the below average attention span.Its popcorn fodder, with plenty of crash, bang, wallops! But no substance, and hardly an excuse to even call this a 'Mad Max' movie. Instead, it should be re-named; 'Furiosa', the name of Charlize Theron's character.\",\n",

Since first appearing on the big screen with THE 40-YEAR-OLD VIRGIN, the clan has proved they can make more-than-the-usual gross-out movie and populate it with realistic, well-rounded characters. The plots for most, if not all, their movies involve characters (normally slacker types) who drink, get high, date, and all-too-easily wind up making mistakes that have consequences. And while the humor tends toward the gross-out, the clan likes to portray the human body and it's functions in a matter-of-fact way.Anyway, on to FORGETTING SARAH MARSHALL. For anyone who's ever had someone break up with them, only to subsequently see them everywhere, here's a film for you. Personally I know, I've been there. Peter (played by the always quirky Jason Segal) has been dating Sarah Marshall, a famous TV star, that is of course until she surprises him one afternoon and breaks up with him. Peter is devastated and forlorn. So, on the advice from his half-brother (played by the equally quirky Bill Hader) Peter takes a vacation. Bound for Hawaii. Unfortunately, Sarah (Kristen Bell) is also vacationing there with her new boyfriend, a controversial rock star played by Russell Brand. Caught in the middle of all this is Rachel (Mila Kunis) who likes Peter and may be the one to help him rebound from the heartbreak. And that's the main story in a nutshell. There are so many funny and poignant little moments that I wouldn't think of revealing any. A movie like this is meant to be savored. Speaking personally, I also liked the sub-story involving the newlyweds. Their story alone could make for an interesting film.

If the story itself doesn't grab you from the get- go, the cinematography will draw you in. This film looks absolutely amazing. This film should be used in film classes until the end of time.

While Sean Harris's new baddie isn't quite as captivating as Phillip Seymour Hoffman's was in Mission Impossible 3, his character is fleshed out well and given enough screen time and dialogue to leave a solid impression. It helps that he's truly Ethan's intellectual equal and actually pushes our protagonist to his limits.Speaking of Ethan, Tom Cruise is in top form as always. He's been entertaining us for decades and has no intention of slowing down. He slides into the role effortlessly and is as convincing as ever as the IMF agent he's portrayed five times over the past 20 years. Whether its having a laugh with the team, recovering from defeat or hanging out on the side of a plane that's taking off, he does it all - and does it all very well.Its nice to see that the entire ensemble gets good parts too. Jeremy Renner plays a pivotal role and while he doesn't have much action, has some of the best lines of the film and is important to the story. Same goes for Simon Pegg who's as entertaining as ever playing Benji. Ving Rhames - the only other actor who has appeared in all five Mission films leaves a mark too and has his moments to shine. The real surprise however, is Rebecca Ferguson. Her character's loyalties are in question for most of the movie, making her incredibly interesting and her performance is flawless. Alec Baldwin makes the most of his brief appearance and is a treat whenever he's on screen.The action sequences are beautifully choreographed and stunningly shot. Good editing ensures they flow well and are easy to follow, never seeming choppy or overwhelming. There's a lot more in store than the much publicized plane sequence, that the marketing team has done a good job keeping unseen.The film is a globe trotting adventure and visits many locations, and each is distinctively captured and given its own look and feel. The script is smart as well as funny and at no point during the film's 130 minutes did I find myself bored or uninterested. Christopher McQuarrie's direction is confident and he ensures all the well done individual elements come together well for a great finished product.Mission Impossible - Rogue Nation is a slick, thrilling and incredibly entertaining blockbuster that has enough substance to match its style. I highly recommend you accept this mission and check it out when it comes out in theaters and IMAX this weekend.\",\n",
              " 'Fletcher Reede (Jim Carrey), is a lawyer who is estranged from his wife Audrey (Maura Tierney). His occupations maintain him far from his home and particularly from his son Max. But he really loves him. One day, for his birthday, Max wishes that his father can\\'t lie for 24 hours. His wish will come true since for 24 hours, Reede will be through a living hell. One must suffer to improve oneself...With \"Liar Liar\", the authors set themselves the following target: to conceive a tailor-made movie for Jim Carrey. Why? Because they surely realized that their topic was thin and it would pose problems to write a screenplay holding water. So, to compensate for the very reduced potential of the script they decided to give Carrey a free hand and to leave a very important part of the film in his hands. Thus, the actor, once revealed with \"the Mask\" (1994) gets out again, without trying to bring anything new to his acting his comical elements that secured his success. It means: his grimaces, his showy expressions and his implausible cues for a kind of one man-show which often borders on the unacceptable. Carrey does his best to bring an ounce of credibility to his character but his bombastic (the term is weak) performance only succeeds in massacring the film. Worse, his third-rate acting is so significant that it leaves little place to the other actors\\' acting. Actors who try with difficulty to play opposite Carrey.This poor comedy shows once again that exclusively relying on a main actor to save a film can be a serious mistake. Fortunately, it seems that Carrey after this flick wanted to give the image of a conscientious actor capable to direct his career. Indeed, we will see him holding more serious roles where he will be able to restrain his tendency to third-rate acting. Try \"the Truman Show\" (1998), \"Man on the Moon\" (1999) or more recently \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\" (2004). Let\\'s hope he goes on and perseveres in this way.',\n",

              " \"Being an X-Men fan, I was expecting superb action in the movie. Whereas the storyline is decent, the movie seriously lacks noteworthy action. This is an ongoing trend that movie goers in US are giving more weightage to story than action. And that's what probably drives the directors to focus more on script.However, last thing we expect from an X-Men movie is inferior action. Even a single comics of X-Men, a single episode of X-men animation, has more action than this movie. Lack of action means all the fun has been dragged away this time. The only fight I really enjoyed was the slo-mo action sequence with QuickSilver. Now that was IMPRESSIVE!Coming to plot. Q1. Wasn't Quicksilver the son of Magneto? Then what's with the new story? Q2. Why can't Kitty send Wolverine back in time to kill Trask before he creates Sentinel program? Or stop him from even being born?Q3. What's with Magneto's mood. First he tries to kill Mystique. Failing which he tries to kill Nixon! Wouldn't killing Nixon only ascertain the inevitable?Q4. The ending was most questionable. If the past is changed, wouldn't the future be changed in a PARALLEL universe instead of the one from which Wolverine's sent? OR, if there is NO PARALLEL universe, the future should have changed the moment Wolverine's consciousness was sent back. Instead, the future remains unchanged for the same time for which the past is unchanged. So, basically you are applying the concept (timeline) of Parallel Universe WITHOUT ANY PARALLEL universe. Wow!I know that Mindless action is appreciated by none. But please don't forget that it's a superhero movie for god's sake. See Avengers for example. Decent story, lots of comic moments and great action. Yet even with Sentinels in this movie, action is far from explosive.If story is what you want from an X-Men movie, by all means do enjoy this one. But if you want decent action, you are better off watching X2 for the nth time than Days of Future Past.\",\n",
              " 'The name \"Office Christmas Party\" does not do any justice with the movie. At ALL.

When I saw the advertisement of this movie on a bus, I was super excited. I have had my fair share of office Christmas parties so I thought \"oh goody, someone finally thought of this. This will be crazy funny.\" With Jason Bateman, Jennifer Aniston, T.J. Miller, Rob Corddry, Karan Soni, Fortune Femister, Jillian Bell, Kate Mckinnon and Matt Walsh, I thought this is already a super hit. Something in the same class as Old School. But\\x85but I was so wrong. The film doesn\\'t deal with what is actually happening at the party which it should since there is always so much material to go on but instead it shows a mean person and a good person, sigh the old evil and good never ending clich√© after clich√© goes on and on. I watched all of it and quite frankly it is just a groan out loud movie. Try again people and try to stick to the themed title of the movie instead of opening up so many fronts where you are not able to close them back.',\n",
              " \"Joel and Ethan Coen (No Country for Old Men, Fargo) have extended their filmmaking prowess into new territory by adapting Charles Portis' famous novel, True Grit, and their interpretation is a refreshing take on the western genre and compares favorably to the memorable John Wayne starring version of 1969. Purists who thought it would be sacrilege to remake a western classic have little to fear. Thanks to a smart script and strong acting, True Grit comes off as a very solid film with some similarities and noticeable differences from the original film.Told in flashback by a woman's voice, a 14 year old Mattie Ross (Hailee Steinfeld) wants to avenge the murder of her father at the hands of Tom Chaney (a grizzled Josh Brolin), and she arrives in a small town to hire Marshal Rooster Cogburn (Jeff Bridges), an aged, hard drinking veteran lawman who has done his share of killing and more. Mattie is not one to be trifled with and as another pursuer, Texas Ranger LaBoeuf (Matt Damon), realizes, not one to intimidate. Headstrong, she has grit herself. Together the trio search for Chaney and seek out a lead in another outlaw, Ned Pepper (an unrecognizable Barry Pepper). As friction mounts among the searchers, LeBoeuf strikes out on his own, and Cogburn and Mattie come upon a cabin. There, a couple of outlaws are smoked out, and this leads to Ned Pepper and his gang. Can Chaney be far behind? It all culminates in a final confrontation between Cogburn and Ned Pepper as Mattie comes face to face with her quarry and LeBoeuf reenters the scene with violent results.Bridges (Crazy Hearts) is utterly convincing in making this version of Rooster Cogburn his own persona. He portrays him as a proud, grumpy curmudgeon who just may be a crack shot and smarter than he lets on. This takes nothing away from the over the top performance of John Wayne who won an Oscar for his rendition. You could almost see Tommy Lee Jones in this role. We gets bits and pieces of Cogburn's past, and some of the tales make you wonder if they are utter fabrications or sheer exaggeration. Steinfeld is a marvel in her first movie role. She embodies Mattie as a take charge gal who will not be deterred and has enough smarts and spunk to strike a hard bargain with any man. Witness her amusing negotiations with a horse trader and wearing him down. Damon (Good Will Hunting) does well in a supporting role and adds more nuance than Glen Campbell's version of LaBoeuf did in the older version. Brolin and Pepper have what amount to small but memorable screen time as the bad guys.The dynamics of the trio are interestingly portrayed as LeBoeuf and Cogburn face off and trade barbs, while Mattie asserts herself every chance she gets. You even think there might be a hint of attraction between Mattie and LeBoeuf. The arc of LeBoeuf's character deviates from the 1969 film significantly especially at the climax. The only negative is that his fate is left open ended and unresolved.Much of the film is superior to the older version. There is really only one scene that would suffer in comparison to the original film, and that is the climactic charge by Cogburn against the bad guys. Bridges does well but he is not John Wayne. The scene lacks the heroic, mythic feel of Wayne. Also, when Bridges is shown in closeup carrying Mattie to safety, it seems a bit phony. But those are minor observations. A final sequence shows what happens many years afterward and serves as a melancholy postscript, and it has a final feel of a film like Unforgiven. The film could easily work without it though.Thanks to the Coens, the authentic sounding dialogue, which is laced with humorous moments including a shooting contest between Cogburn and LeBoeuf, is peppy and sharp, a marked improvement from standard western fare. There are times when Bridges' drawling and inflections are hard to understand but you get the gist anyway through context and body language. Technical crafts are standout especially a good musical score by Carter Burwell and beautiful cinematography by veteran Roger Deakins (A Beautiful Mind).The Coen brothers must have been drawn to the quirky characters and the language of the novel, and while this is certainly not their best film, it is a very entertaining western with some standout performances.\",\n",
              " \"Have you ever heard about the movie Legally Blonde? Well, I have certainly heard about it, but I just never watched it. That changed last night. I was a kind of tired and it didn't seem like a hard to watch movie. So I decided to put on Legally Blonde.In the beginning you just get to know the character (Elle Woods) a little more. Everything is going wrong (of course), because her boyfriend wants to break up. He thinks Elle is too immature for him, if he ever wants to be a successful lawyer. She wants to prove the opposite to him and decides to go to Harvard Law School all of a sudden. You can imagine that not everything is going as planned for Elle, but will she make up for it?In my opinion this movie is a feelgood movie. You don't really have to think during the movie, you can just sit back. Some scenes in the movie are too crazy to imagine that something like that will ever happen to you, but I think this makes it really fun to watch. Moreover, because you can sit back and relax, you will feel compassion for the main character during the movie. On the other hand you can predict most of the movie, because most of the events you've seen in dozen of the movies. There is not really an element of surprise in the film and I think that's a pity. Overall I really liked watching this movie and I would recommend it, because it will really gives you a happy feeling and it is quite funny.\",\n",

              " \"Wonder Woman is a sincere film. Its heart is in the right place. It's thematically bang on. It's important. I'm very glad it exists. I'm glad it's being universally praised. It has some fantastic costume work in it and some strong production design. It is, indeed, better than recent previous attempts at bringing DC characters to the big screen (but then the bar has been set pretty low). I see little girls dressing as the protagonist and it makes my heart sing. I see comic book stores hosting Wonder Woman Day, I see the world falling in love with a character that I've always adored. These are all wonderful things. I was very excited for this flick. When the reviews were coming in strong, I let my hopes get high. I admit that I actively ignored my Rotten Tomatoes rule of thumb (any movie with more than 90% RT rating has a huge probability of sucking).But the film is, subjectively, pretty bad.It is overwrought. It is written as if by algorithm, meaning that it is simply an amalgamation of standard scenes you've seen before in other movies, just reskinned for this world and this character, everyone acts out every scene in extremely predictable ways. Its third act fight scene is extremely problematic and boring. It is inconsistent, Wonder Woman's presence and powers fluctuate so wildly that she can fight and kill a god, but not a handful of German's with WW I era rifles on a beach? The CGI is criminally bad, the physics in the special effects shots are so off that it seems like I'm watching a last gen video game.Its dialogue has exactly three modes: exposition, clumsy attempts at humor, and stating out loud the thematic intent of the scene.Its fight scenes are more often excuses to pose the character than acts of complex, readable staging, particularly the awful final fight. The use of slow motion in the fight scenes is so reliable and consistent that it seems like a parody of Zach Snyder's already completely unengaged video game fight choreography.The villains mean nothing. They are uninspired, dreary, and underutilized. Apart from seeing the very well visualized Themyscira, and the handful of times we get to see Wonder Woman in action, there is very little fun to be had in this movie. There is almost nothing that feels inventive and most of the film is colored in that same drab, dreary way that all of the recent DC films are colored.The movie is looooong, with a running time that used to be reserved for movies like The Piano, The Godfather, and Apocalypse Now, films with sprawling cinematic, thematic, and emotive ambitions that this does not even begin to have.Lastly, I can't tell if Gadot is incapable of acting or if the script gave her so little of substance to work with that she did an amazing job just keeping it all together.I have to ask why? Why does the DC universe so actively avoid fun, immersive, well crafted, and inventive storytelling? Why do they double down on this faux-epic, dismal pap? Why are they so afraid of color? Of bold comic-book like choices? Personally, I wish I had watched a little bit of Wonder Woman on cable and then turned it off like I have every other recent DC movie, but maybe voting with my dollar at least helped change the backward ass notion that women can't open big budget movies.Oh, well. As I said, the most important thing is that this movie exists, that people like it and that the character is back in the spotlight. That's all that matters. My opinion certainly doesn't. This wasn't a soulless or intellectually bankrupt film like the other DC movies have been, it was just bad, but maybe bad is good enough.\",\n",
              " \"I knew very little about the story before watching this but even from the beginning I knew that I would not be disappointed. From the moment we meet first meet the bitter and angry Sweeney Todd to the dramatic climax. The cast itself was an excellent mixture of known and unknown actors/actresses who all played their roles to perfection and of course the delightful Johnny Depp who shows us why he's such a sought after actor not only can he act, he can sing as well! Not just Johnny though but all the actors did an amazing job of singing and acting Alan Rickman, Helene Boham Carter, Timothy Spall, and even Sacha Baron Cohen! The story itself is a wonderful dark macabre story, the underscore music fitted perfectly with dark undertones of the story along with delightfully wicked dark humour. The chemistry between Helene's character (Mrs Lovett) and Sweeney Todd (Depp) was fantastic to watch as she fell deeper and deeper in love with him even willing to lie to him about his wife being alive - she did tell him his wife poisoned herself but neglected to mention that she was still alive albeit a bit loopy. Rickman and Spall did a excellent job of playing the evil judge and the cruel corrupted Beadle, all through out the story you could sympathise with Sweeney and I wanted him to kill the nasty pair because they were just simply vile evil creatures. I even found myself cheering when he finally did kill them but takes a rather sad, tragic and ironic twist at the end where after Sweeney murders the mad beggar woman he orders Mrs Lovett to open the oven door and in the firelight he sees that it was his wife that he had murdered. Driven insane with rage he turns on the woman who loves him Mrs Lovett and kills her in the worse possible way by burning her alive in the oven and shutting the door. Beside himself with grief he clings to his wife's dead body not noticing the small boy that Mrs Lovett took in who sneaks up behind him slits his throat with his own razor his blood poring over his dead wife's body the boy leaves the underground bakehouse. This is an excellent film I would gladly watch again and again.Jumana\",\n",
              " \"Although titled 'Lincoln' this Spielberg movie is not a biopic but the story of the passing of the 13th Amendment, abolishing slavery. In so far as it focuses on the culmination of Lincoln's life and political career it might indeed be said to be hagiography, a piece of hero- worship which presumably will have more appeal to American patriots than to others. We actually learn very little about Lincoln's background , early life and rise to power, which is a pity as they make a fascinating story in themselves.Visually it is an absorbing film, replete with period detail and atmosphere, and Daniel Day-Lewis's portrayal of the beleaguered President is stunning (although his accent reminded me of Walter Brennan's 'Stumpy' in Rio Bravo, an incongruous comparison). But for me the man who steals the show is Tommy Lee Jones as Thaddeus Stevens, the rabble rousing leader of the Radicals, whose performance is ever watchable.Although there are a few battlefield scenes and glimpses of Lincoln's family life, the movie revolves around the debates on the Amendment on the floor of the House of Representatives. I was struck by the resemblance to those court-room dramas beloved of Americans, punctuated by cries of 'Objection!' and 'Clear the court!' 'Lincoln' could, perhaps, be seen as a scaled-up courtroom drama, with Lincoln the man on trial and the congressmen the jury. A noticeable weakness in the dramatic structure, however, is that the 'accused' himself never appears in the 'courtroom' (presumably that would be un-Constitutional) so that the 'trial' is conducted through intermediaries. Dramatic tension is further weakened because we already know the outcome - the Amendment is passed, slavery is abolished, the War is ended.Many of the interchanges between congressmen, although passionate, are perhaps overly-long and complex unless you are a keen student of American history. On that point, there are several scenes which would presumably resonate much more strongly with a US audience (e.g. the surrender at Appomattox) than they did with myself. It also did not seem clear quite why abolishing slavery and ending the war were in direct conflict with each other, the raison-d'etre of Lincoln's personal and political dilemma. The movie's ending is baffling. We all know that Lincoln was assassinated by a gunman while watching a theatre performance. Fine. We see a theatre performance and expect to witness the ghastly deed. But no - the central character is absent once more. A man rushes onto the stage to announce that 'The President has been shot!' Where? We're in the theatre but we didn't see it! What's going on? Did I miss something? Cut to scene of Lincoln on a bed, being pronounced dead by a physician. Seems we were in some other theatre where his young son is in the audience so that we can witness his pain on hearing that his father is dead. We've been fooled but not in a good way.The movie is not without clich√©s - swelling music as the Amendment is passed, some rather self-absorbed story-telling by Lincoln, slightly sycophantic admiration from the younger generation, and a kind of beyond-the-grave finale. It's all a strange mixture.Not one of Spielberg's best movies but some patience and a little preparation on the historical background may enhance enjoyment. Even so, still worth a look.(Viewd at the Odeon, Westbrook, Warrington, UK 04.02.13)\",\n",

(Never would have worked between you? What do you call this, wedded bliss?) Anyway, my wishes aside, this was an excellent movie. Even the most minor of characters gave an stellar performance, and the special effects were literally out of this world.

I wasn\\'t a huge fan of Crimson peak, but the Shape Of Water really looked intriguing from the trailers. I sat there blown away by what I was seeing. This is one of my favorite films of 2017. It is unique, original, interesting, intriguing, and weird all at the same time.Sally Hawkins gives a really great performance in one of the most inspirational performances I have ever seen. her character is mute and has no lines of dialogue aside from a dream sequence, but man does she play this character with confidence. The supporting cast also does a really great job, Michael Shannon of course being the next standout, and no one phone sin a performance at all. This film has that old school vibe to it. There is a use of a lot of practical effects, and the makeup and hairstyling is some of the best I\\'ve seen on film this year. The amphibian creature, if it is motion captured, is seamlessly integrated into the movie that the use of practical effects looks so appealing.The set designs are also really great. Lots of little details that you have to pay attention to that you wouldn\\'t normally pay attention to. The lighting in these scenes also adds a lot of depth to the movie. There are scenes that are dim for a reason, and some with more lighting for a reason. It is really a great way to use lighting to convey the details of the environment. This is a story that grabbed me from the beginning. Not once was I bored watching this movie. It kept me engaged and there is so much character development that it ended up making me care at the end. Out of all of the characters that you root for, there is not one single character that you end up not liking.And if my memory serves me correctly, there is not one scene of exposition in this film. Not one. There are some \"hints\" here and there as to what is going on in the background, but from what I remember it\\'s not explicitly stated. It leaves it up to you to put together all of the clues and I really like that about this film.I\\'m happy we got something original in Hollywood. Everyone craves for something original, and then everyone hates it when something original comes out. It was a nice breath to just see something so refreshing instead of plot threads being retreaded and following clich√©s that we see in movies nowadays. This is one of my favorite films of the year.I am going to give \"The Shape Of Water\" an A+.',\n",

              " \"This was an extraordinary film, spanning many centuries and many past and future lives of a select few souls.I haven't read the book but after seeing this film I will definitely be buying a copy. My understanding of the movie is as follows:1) Each of us has soul-mates, and these are souls who we have a connection with in our current life, and also in our past and future lives. A soul-mate isn't necessarily our lover but can also be an enemy or a friend or an employer or a relative. If they are not already part of your life then your paths will one day cross and when it does you will be drawn to each other and will continue to be drawn to each other in every future life, in what ever capacity.2) After death, the soul is reincarnated in to a different body. The soul remains the same, but the body is different. Somehow, the soul recognises other key souls from previous lives, even though the body is different. The relationships between souls are different in each life. For example, two souls could be lovers in one life, colleagues in another life and friends in another life. Despite the relationship, the same souls are drawn to each other in each lifetime.3) In the movie, the same actor is used to depict each soul's journey, so that the viewer can see the past and future lives of each soul. In each past and future life, the soul will have a different body, a different face, and even a different gender or ethnicity but the soul remains the same. This would be impossible to film, so to make it easy for viewers to understand what's happening, the same actor has been used in the various lives of each soul. 4) From womb to tomb, we are bound to others. From birth until death, we are bound to our soul-mates and every decision we make affects those around us and can potentially ripple through the centuries. 5) The soul evolves over the course of many lifetimes, so that you could be an evil murderous doctor in one lifetime, a murderous writer in another, a brave and unfortunate scientist in another, and a courageous and loyal survivor in another. It's as though the soul learns lessons in each life which can impact on the next life. I'm sure there was much more to the film than that but nevertheless these are the main things that stood out to me. I can't wait to read the book now. This movie is definitely worth watching a few times!\",\n",

There was A lot of violence but other than that a great story line and great actresses to play the roles of the 6 main characters. Congrats to the director for coming up with this story! The way those crawlers can sneak up on them and then in the blink of an eye be gone was amazing. The special effects were amazing they were so realistic and spooky. if you like movies that have a lot of blood and gore and make you jump every 5 minutes then i definitely recommend that you go see this movie because it has all that and more!',\n",

The acting is just OK, both Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence, let alone Academy Award standard. I watch the movie and I think it's just a standard romantic comedy, nothing so special and I can't really get the hype about it. There are a lot of more authentic and astounding movies that are worth watching way more than The Silver linings Playbook. This is not a bad movie, but it's just not excellent and I don't think it deserves all the good things people have said about. I loved Jennifer Lawrence in Winter Bones and I think she's gonna make a lot of good movies, but Bradley Cooper's acting is not my favorite.\",\n",

Where to begin... First thing that came to mind, the SFX, I know that is not the be all and end all, but it's worse than star wars, and thats saying something. The first action scene was so incoherent, I nearly turned it off, wish I had done. So the plot: Some green goo from any clich√© sci fi movie gets stolen, oh no... so great, you can see its got stolen, now lets spend 10 minutes explaining to the viewer that its stolen... Thinking back, I don't think anything beyond the obvious is explained, the audience is treated so lowly, it just injects searing boredom into you. so yes, green goo stolen, sterile love interest is introduced, 10 minutes spent looking at holograms bla bla bla boring.The characters are as deep as the underside of a mug, none of them connectible, or even worth bearing a thought whilst they are off screen.So plot is boring, characters are boring, sodden in clich√©s, sfx is painful to watch, surly the cool gadgets are good? 'its the future', these ideas are worse than the ones in the electrical isle in pound-land, my god they are stupid.

Well critics rating and its ranking speaks very much about it.We have seen many movies about Nazis hatred for jews, including some really good movies like The downfall(2004),Inglorious Bastards(2009) and many more,but this movie is different..because it shows how a man can help others,if he wants to while remaining in his limits & working under constraints.

              " 'This is my first time on IMDb or any other sites similar, simply because I feel I need to set some things straight. I have no idea why this film has such bad reviews. Having been an avid follower of the series since it began I still went into this movie prepared for the worst and ready to be critical if need be (because of the reviews I had heard). Start to finish however I don\\'t think I moved once. I genuinely think this is almost the best of the four, beaten only perhaps by the first for obvious reasons. I thoroughly appreciated the way the directors have kept the films to the book and Mockingjay PtII was no exception. Jennifer Lawrence is absolutely outstanding in this film and by all means deserves to be well recognized for her performance. The others also should not be forgotten, Liam Hemsworth really stepped out in this film as did many of the other supporting acts. For those complaining it was slow paced, I am not sure what you wanted. It kept me on edge the entire way through and was actually enhanced by the moments of quieter reflection that other \"action\" movies often lack. It contained immense depth, astounding cinematography and visual effects. Lastly, I think the ending was utterly beautiful. This book, this series, is somber. It\\'s dark, its reflective and it alludes to a number of very serious themes. The directors dealt with this incredibly well. The film is a perfect ending to the series, my only disappointment is that it is the last.',\n",
              " \"I have no problem with movies that take liberty with the original source material if it makes a good movie. I don't care who the real First Class was in X-Men, it was a good movie. The Hunger Games was better than the book and it was a faithful adaptation. That said this movie is also very faithful to the book. Unfortunately this makes for a poor movie.I've read the book by Orson Scott Card and I wasn't really impressed. It was fine but it didn't leave me wanting to read any of the sequels. The book was mainly about a boy and his ability to lead. I guess the movie is the same but it's done horribly. First of all more than half of the book is about Ender in battle school. It's about how he's being mistreated and despite it all he makes friends and persevere through tactical fortitude and good will. There is a bit of that but none of it is fleshed out. None of the characters besides Ender is actually a character. I can't even remember a single one of them except Bean because he was cool in the book. They're all one dimensional and when they all come together at the end, it doesn't have any impact since we barely saw any struggle for Ender to begin with aside from one other kid who comes across as a psychopath.I watched this with others who have never read the book and they kind of had no idea what the hell was going on. Blatant exposition scenes didn't help much and there was a lot of random shots on the battle school floating around for no apparent reason. The ending sets up a sequel that no one wants to see and the whole movie is just a mess. The special effects are well done but that's about the only thing done well in the whole movie.\",\n",

To be honest i only got to know him in American Psycho, a movie where I felt like he was copying Cruise as good as he could. Watching some other movies, I can say poot Christian can not act. He has one character, his alter ego perhaps, which he brings in each movie he's asked to play in. About the movie? Well imagine that. Bale in fact fits in his role and delivers exactly what he's asked to deliver. I will not discuss whether this is because he finally learnt how to act or if it is because the role itself asked for what he can only do (which is what I personally believe anyhow) but still, he really does exceed anyone's expectations.(spoiler) Taye once more plays the macho character who (SPOILER) will fall as in the case of the way of the gun. (/spoiler end) All in all the movie does not base itself on the performances of the actors although as i already said, Bale does deliver exactly what is expected from him, if not more. (minor spoiler) Bean? Well as in all his other movies...(/spoiler end) Characters? Well they dont really build up in front of you although Preston's character (Bale) is given a certain depth and an attempt is made to relate the viewer's with him. Didnt work with me but it's certainly there.The movie has a smoothly fitting soundtrack to go with the action, some great action scenes which really give another meaning to the word action, fast pace, intense moves, and a very few meanings underneath the glossy hollywood feel perhaps. (spoiler) the last fighting scene in the movie will certainly be remembered as one of the most original as (SPOILER) instead of having people shooting each other -matrix- or what was even worse, shooting each other from an arm's distance -art of war- here, most effort is made to avoid being shot rather than shooting the opponent.(/spoiler end)I gave this movie a rating of 7. I just watched it last night though and tonight I am going to watch it once more. Perhaps the second time will make me reconsider and come change a thing or two. But probably not. The movie manages beautifully to avoid the cult and the following of the matrix while still incorporating many ideas and techniques from it.\\nAt the end of the day, you will come back and think about the movie, perhaps not because of the drama but certainly because you will find something therein to trigger your interest.

But she kills him in the end in a rage of jealousy. What aroused my excitement was all the famous oldtimers who appeared as themselves in Gloria Swanson's career were also in this picture, ie.

Directing is efficient, the way the characters move through the flashbacks is interesting. Josh Brolin is good, although not exactly at his best. Showing briefly how the world change in 2 decades (the main character not knowing a thing about search engines or apps, and wondering where are public phones and yellow pages books) works fine. Alas, these fews bright spots can\\'t mask the lack of understanding of the original piece, and the general mediocrity of this remake. Every character outside Brolin is almost empty. Elizabeth Olsen should look like a being of pure compassion, not a simpleton who just follows a strange wounded man for no reason. Sam Jackson? well he does a classic sam jackson part, no more, no less... Sharlto copley? OH COME ON!! he can (and has done) so much better than that!! He can be fun, witty, lost, cold, vicious, and here he\\'s just... a parody of an European decadent snob... missing his old days of incest with his sister and father. the story? BLAH. (yes, BLAH.) Seriously, Spike lee either did not understand the korean original, or let the producers wrote whatever they wanted just to cash his check. I mean, how can the Director of inside man, a smart, well thought movie, let this piece of nonsense make it to the screen?? the end is void of meaning, and quite the opposite of the original. And where the gore of the original was used with caution and purpose, blood is here splashed with no reason except maybe getting sure the movie got rated R.The choreography of the fight scenes is a bit more challenging to rate : I\\'m not sure if the very... well, choreographed, unnatural looks of the fights is a result of poor stunt training and filming, or at the contrary a way to give it a surreal look, since the \"hero\" learn to fight on TV action flicks...

              " 'Following David Fincher\\'s masterpiece \"Seven\", he collaborated with Brad Pitt again to make an adaptation of Chuch Palahiunk\\'s novel \"Fight Club\". The screenplay by Jim Uhls has much to be desired, however what is there is a major exercise in black comedy and sheer anti-social examples of what is making our society as diverse as possible. Some people could agree with the \\'Charles Manson\\' of modern day society (Tyler Durden-Pitt) and say that our world is turning in a direction of which we cannot follow, and that if we cannot find reason to be different or not cater to the white-collars, then we need to pummel each other to take out bottled up anger that is created during a day in our little cubicles, suffocating in the depths of paperwork prescribed by our bosses and many other reasons to punch holes through our cheeks. Edward Norton is the lead, and does the average Joe justice as the insomniac looking for a way to escape from the day to day life that our environment is nurtering. And, after going to self-help groups for men and woman who have cancer, he meets a mysterious woman who could threaten his relief, a woman who he believes has no such cancer. On a plane a short period after, he meets the man who took control of his demeanor and the very way he talked, thinked and judged society. After a nice talk about air travel, they part ways. When Norton\\'s character returns to his condominium (his sanctuary, the place where he devoted his life, money and time, into the decor and very atmosphere where he could live) only to find it blown to pieces by a gas leak. He calls Tyler. They meet, have a beer and talk about the devastation. They walk outside and agree for Norton to stay at Pitt\\'s house on Paper Street. Tyler Durden requests one favor before he can stay with him: he wants Norton to hit him as hard as he can. The way that Norton\\'s character could only feel good in the arms of someone who is truly in pain, made me wonder. When Durden said \"We are all raised to think we will grow up to be rich and famous movie stars,\" that made me think. But when the two started fighting, the plot took a turn for the worst. Now, the story then goes from a club for men attempting fiendishly to channel the aggression they could not before, turns into a movie about vandalism and bleak terrorizer to our society. The first few words in the book is Tyler saying, \"the first step to eternal life is you have to die\". The last words are God whispering \"we need to break up civilization so we can make something better of the world.\" Whether or not this is really the case, the thought-provoking sub-text has ample humor, and eventually the story just makes you stop an think, \"is that true? Or have I just gotten used to not thinking about the meaning of things?\" Raw. Scathing. Satirical and hot. Funny.',\n",
              " \"The Road is one powerful book, written brilliantly by Cormac McCarthy. It's about a father and son walking through post apocalyptic America and explores their bond when all else is lost. Due to the unconventional style of the prose, it's not a hugely filmable book but it still got adapted. This is a decent but boring adaptation. Starting with the positives, Viggo Mortensen and Kodi Smit-McPhee are excellent as the two main characters. The father is a very interesting character, but Smit-McPhee steals the show as the boy, providing one of the best child actor performances of recent times. John Hillcoat's direction is suitably bleak and haunting, and the landscapes are atmospheric and haunting. It's got a decent and faithful script, and it goes into some of the darkness of the book. The Road is a deep story with many very powerful themes, and this adaptation brings some though not all of them to life.The truth is, The Road just doesn't work brilliantly as a film. It feels disconnected and incoherent as it simply jumps from scene to scene. It's also a fairly dull movie as nothing much is really happening most of the time. It is powerful in a certain way, but it's too drained and depressing to actually want to engage much in. It's just a big, monotonous slog through endless grey landscapes without a hint of warmth or hope. This was brought to life to great effect by McCarthy but as a film it just doesn't work. At the same time, the father and son relationship can feel a bit too warm and although this flaw is fixed in the second half it feels somewhat cowardly and an attempt to appeal to more audience members, although the film's commitment to the book is admirable. A big of a trudge through miserable post apocalyptic imagery overall. Quite moving and sad but just not enjoyable. Definitely not for everyone.6/10\",\n",

              " 'Am√©lie is a movie of superlatives. It is the most powerful, moving and adorable film I have ever seen. So let me tell you how this film became my favorite of all-time: On one side, the actors fit perfectly into the image of the city of love: Paris. They are created for a non-existing dream world, where every single person has its place and love is around everywhere. On the other side, France\\'s elementary culture subliminally manifests throughout the whole film. It is maybe just because of this fact that the movie abstains from the image of the modern city of Paris, which could eventually have destroyed the film\\'s charisma. The viewer is somehow guided into several parallel worlds like the Montmartre caf√© \"Deux Moulins\", the trains of thoughts by Am√©lie or a world of an ill man, the \"glass-bone man\". If you expect the movie to be made out of silk, then you are certainly on the wrong track. Am√©lie, who has never experienced luck and happiness in her life because her mother died when she was a little child, grows to an angelic figure over the time, trying to solve little grievances in the everyday life of other people. With sophisticated pranks against the mean ones and the support for the socially weak she achieves her aims to make world a better place. Her only problem is that she forgets to care about herself and her own life. She is not able to establish a real relationship because she is always forced to help others. On one day she gets to know her neighbor in the apartment house, the \"glass-bone\" man. He is one of the socially weak because he cannot leave his flat without the danger of breaking his bones. His everyday activity is to copy masterworks and to treat the stories of people he discovers in the paintings. It is him who helps Am√©lie breaking out and to work up the courage to meet a man she saw at the metro station and with whom she fell in love. Am√©lie is finally rewarded for all her efforts and justice takes its course...At the end of the movie, I could almost live the passion of the unselfish protagonist and emotions flew high. It is very rare that a film without a high degree of drama can touch my heart but this one could. It is the power of love that triumphs over the whole two hours the movie lasts. I regard this film not only as a story about people with love in their hearts; it is a statement to the world that Am√©lie actually has not succeeded to save the whole world although she could enlighten her small environment and this is what every person should and can do. I must honestly admit that I\\'ve eventually not understood the whole deep meaning behind it because there are so many small but important things in the movie that could be mentioned here. If you ever happen to see this movie, be prepared for a huge dose of happiness but also fun and humor.',\n",

The cinematography was fantastic, and it needed to be. The adaptation from Broadway to the silver screen must be a difficult one. The special effects are great. In fact, this movie is phenomenally visually stunning. There was nothing I would change about this movie.It was nice that those who cast this movie did not succumb to the temptation of casting famous faces, as that would have distracted the viewers from the movie itself. Yes, I walked into this movie thinking I would like it (but then, hopefully, that is true with all movies one sees in theaters), especially since I adore music and the previews made it seem like my sort of movie. Still, I was blown away. This movie transcends its categorization as a \"musical,\" since it is a romance and a character drama. This movie contains all the right ingredients- great romance, poignant characters, and a story that easily captures hearts. Add the exquisite vision of the director, good acting (the hilarious over-the-top character of La Carlotta, played by Minnie Driver)and players with natural charisma and sex appeal that allows explosive passion, and place on top the time-defying beauty of its songs, and you find yourself with a hit that will take your breath away every single time you see it.',\n",
              " \"First thing's first: there's something extremely reassuring when a movie comes along with absolutely no pretensions about itself and tries to do nothing else other than what it says on the tin. It's fair to say that this is a no holds barred exploitation movie \\x96 the kind that were a staple of the 70s and 80s \\x96 and this is a badge it very wears proudly And loudly In fact from the outset it shouts its intentions from the highest hilltop with the loudest megaphone it can find. Make no mistake: the term 'guilty pleasure' could have been coined for this particular film A man (Richard Dreyfuss in a neat Jaws homage/cameo) is out fishing on a lake when there's a sudden undersea earthquake. Said earthquake unleashes an entire population of prehistoric piranha fish, previously thought to be extinct. They are extremely hungry, but luckily for them it's spring break so the waters are teeming with lots and lots of gym toned male and female bodies. In addition to this, sleazy Jerry O' Connell's character is out to make a nudey Internet flick starring Kelly Brook (now she's come a long way since her squeaky clean image on UK show 'The Big Breakfast'), unaware of the havoc that's about to be unleashed all around them. It's up to the Sheriff (played by Elizabeth Shue in a refreshing gender change from the norm) to save everyone's hides (literally) and also her own children \\x96 who, thanks to a neat plot point, are stranded on rapidly sinking/beached yacht after a babysitting stint goes afoul. And so the fun starts with plenty of gore galore.Director Alexandre Aja handles the action and the scares extremely well. After all, it's very hard to get the tone of a movie right where the reaction might be one of mirth one minute and complete terror the next, but Aja succeeds without ever letting the viewer become confused. And there's good tension to be had here. Every time we see a (usually naked) female in the water, we're expecting the inevitable bloodbath, but Aja holds back and holds back The fact is, in his expert hands, we're never entirely sure when or if it's going to happen to a particular character. There's also one particular sequence involving a floating stage toppling over into the ocean, after a deluge of people swamp it while desperately trying to get out of the piranha infested waters that's handled particularly well.Playing the sheriff, Elizabeth Shue is solid and does a good turn on very limited material. It's an understatement to say she looks good in the Sheriff's uniform. Christopher Lloyd also makes a brief appearance in one of his token eccentric roles and adds bit of believability to the proceedings. Jerry O' Connell probably does the best work since he's given a fun and entertaining role he can really get his teeth into.While this is a remake of the original Piranha movie from the late 70s, director Aja has decided to go for a different scenario. Whereas the Joe Dante directed original was made in the shadows of the Vietnam War and concerned shady military experiments, the remake opts for a natural event causing the disaster. This is actually a good idea: in this era of 'climate change' and geological instability, it makes for a more environmentally relevant film. But you can forget about social and environmental commentary because in truth, this movie is essentially about two things: naked babes and killer fish. And boy, do you get plenty of the former In one unashamedly ogling sequence, Kelly Brook and another actress swim, kiss and caress each other underwater (in the nude) in a pointlessly and laughably extended scene that will have viewers giggling at its crassness. In another scene, a woman paragliding behind a speedboat (topless of course) gets her legs bitten off. There's another scene where aw well, you get the picture. This movie won't win any fans among the feminist movement, that's for sure.It's also a tremendously gory movie, especially in the final half hour. In the spirit of the exploitation movies of the past, most of the gory demises are once again aimed at females: a woman get scalped by an outboard motor; another woman is devoured after being bitten in the rear while floating on a hollow rubber inflatable; yet another female's insides fall out after she splits in half while being carried to the shore by two good Samaritans. That's not implying the men get off lightly. In one scene, a character gets his manhood bitten off. Then in an unapologetically tongue-in-cheek move, the aforementioned manhood is spat out at the camera by a piranha suffering from an apparent case of indigestion. Such is the mad tone of this movie: it's crazy from start to finish. One does hope the aforementioned character has a good acting career: if he doesn't, he's liable to be referred as 'wasn't he the guy who got his penis bitten off in Piranha 3D?' Unlike the original 1978 movie and the James Cameron partially directed sequel, all the fish effects here are done with little or no practical effects. For the most part the so-so CGI serves the creatures well, adding an otherworldly quality to their ugly prehistoric appearance. Director Aja also wisely augments these with some nice 'Point of view' shots AKA Jaws (who can forget the piranha POV speeding towards a floating female's behind?).It's fair to say that guys might enjoy this more than the ladies. But it's still a fun and insane film. Yes it's very over the top \\x96 but in a good way. While the movie is incredibly violent and bloody, it remains riveting viewing. If you can get past the distracting female nudity, it's actually a crazy ride from start to finish and provides and entertaining night in. All aboard for the sequel!\",\n",

However to me, a Brit, the script of this film was very clumsy and full of clich√©s. This film attempts to be a dramatic, psychological and philosophical film but ends up a cheesy romance with awkward dialogue that attempts to explain some of the ideas behind the film. Furthermore, quoting Shakespeare and talking in alliteration seems to represent a completely clich√©d view of the British. I came expecting something of the quality of the Matrix trilogy but left having seen something more along the lines of Notting Hill.',\n",
              " 'The Martian is brilliant in the way its presented. Compared to something like Gravity it buries it because it blends a real feeling science fiction adventure with tons of scientific exploration but includes fun, crazy stunts and special effects and a script that is actually very mainstream with humour and plain dialogue which some fans apparently find off-putting. Some reviews said everything was great but the dialogue was silly and it is in a way but I liked that it was plain speak among this insane survival story that is ridiculous and plausible all at once. The performances and the direction of the film make you feel this could have happened.The cast is very good and the starring role of the film is so well done that it carries the movie. I will say honestly that Matt Damon should have been Oscar nominated for his role just because he makes it believable and fun and scary and takes you on this adventure. Yes he gives the role a lot of different tones but I thought it worked perfectly. The supporting cast are really a lot of A-Listers playing his team that want to rescue him and those working to save him for different reasons including Jeff Daniels, Kristen Whig (who actually does a great job in a small but serious role), Jessica Chastain (one of my least favourite actresses but she was very tolerable in this), Michael Pena, Sean Bean, Kata Mara, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Donald Glover (really liked his small but important role), Benedict Wong, and Aksel Hennie are the roles I thought were best performed in small doses. They kept the supporting characters unassuming but with enough charisma that they made a difference so they didn\\'t feel underused but also didn\\'t get in the way either.The Martian is also so good due to the extreme talent of legendary Science Fiction directly Ridley Scott who really seems to work on pure passion. When he loves something he just completely immerses himself in it and brings it to life. You will feel like you are on Mars surviving with this guy and you will become so attached to him. Considering how long the movie covers the pacing is practically perfect and despite essentially being science fiction the special effects are fantastic and don\\'t feel CGI heavy which is an accomplishment. The Martian is easily one of the best movies of 2015 and is unique considering it could have felt like rehashed material from films like Interstellar and Gravity but those both underwhelmed me whereas The Martian met and exceed my expectations so check it out and \"science the sh%t out of this planet!!\" 9/10',\n",

I commend her ability to be able to not be very nice to Brad Pitt and George Clooney in the movie, because I sure wouldn\\'t be able to! *SPOILER HERE, DO NOT READ IF YOU HAVE NOT VIEWED OCEAN\\'S TWELVE: (In addition, I was so happy to see her and Brad get together in the end!!)* George and Brad reprised their skills as thieves, and their characters looked like they knew exactly what they were doing all of the time, which gives a sense of security. Ocean\\'s Twelve also has a very intriguing plot line, though at times a little confusing. I sometimes was like \"What?\" and had to rewind it a couple of times. My brother watched it with me and was very confused: \"Wait, so it was Ocean\\'s Eleven at first, and then the old guy dropped out, but then the old guy dropped back in, and then did Isabel??\" I was just like....um, yeah, okay. This is not a good movie to watch if you are not very sharply observant, or if you get confused easily. But if you love a briskly entertaining movie with lots of mystery and intrigue (and you don\\'t mind rewinding back a few times) then Ocean\\'s Twelve is the movie for you! :)',\n",

Before youth was force fed Marvel Comic adaptation after adaptation after reboot after remake after sequel, there was seriously good, quality material to sink your chops into.Thank goodness for Netflix because without them, \"Stranger Things\" would never have gotten made. I\\'m so glad it did. This was a tour de Force of filmmaking, with stellar performances by Winona Ryder, Millie Bobby Brown and a wonderfully eccentric cast of beloved misfits you embrace from the first episode. You will hear a lot of people compare it to classic 80\\'s films The Goonies, but it\\'s less like those films and more like what would have been created by the Masterful 80\\'s filmmakers that created the flicks that became iconic.This series demonstrates with unapologetic glory what entertainment could be if we allowed more original content into our sphere, rather than the regurgitations and comic saturation that obliterated the blockbuster and dumbed it down to the IQ of a gnat. This is why we remember the 80\\'s films so fondly. They were better.Star Wars was a film that changed the industry, much thanks to the young pioneer George Lucas. Following him through that gate of genius was Steven Spielberg, Robert Zemekis, Ron Howard and so many artists with stories to tell. The Duffer Brothers are a hugely welcome, long overdue addition to that club, and so is their series, \"Stranger things.\"Packed with nods to yesteryear cinema, it never has to rely on sex, drugs and exploding cars to pull you in, but instead grips you with a brilliant storyline and powerful performances. It lets you have fun again, without beating you over the head with the common \"Look how much money we spent\" plague.I hope for a second series. There is no question, this is full of tomorrows biggest stars, especially Millie Bobby Brown whose turn here is mind blowing. Emmy should hand them their awards now.',\n",

I even smoked a little something before we left thinking I could take a nap if it got too boring, but I was too enraged to even sleep. This whole phenomenon is everything that is wrong with this country\\'s youth. First of all, Bella is just a total slag who shows absolutely no consideration towards either of her \"love interests\" and just bounces back and fourth between the two without sitting down and talking to either one of them about her feelings like a HUMAN BEING.

Where other films might show the Germans as the \"baddies\", this film manages to make the viewer look at the German military as more restrained, cultured, dignified and human. They are with the arts, cinema/music, languages, are polite and courteous. Conversely, the Americans and Allies are painted as uneducated, uncultured, sub-human animalistic savages. While neither of these extremes, of course, represent the whole truth, Tarantino seems to intentionally role-reverse the good guy/bad guy concept in this film, particularly. Whether he is doing it to make a statement about the evils of war is dubious. What\\'s clear is that the audience is not cheering on the Jewish cinema owner, whose terrorism / suicide plot is almost Satanic in its portrayal, nor are they cheering on the \"basterds\".This film is not meant to be a parody or commentary on history, but simply a spectacle of unimaginably immoral conduct; where many reviewers might see it a justification of violence, it is plain to see that each member of the \"Inglorious Basterds\", as well as the cinema owner and her accomplice, is in fact motivated by the age-old fallacy of redemption through revenge, which never ends in redemption or satisfaction, but only in tragedy, loss and suffering.',\n",

Despite this being doubtful the story does have potential as a film but one not done in Disney style but in a serious manner without songs or a frivolous story line. The only advantage of this film was that it had potential the rest of the film is just plain silly for an audience. The film in my view should of used the 1956 Yul Brynner film as a guide and adapted it to animation. The characters are too stereotypical and wooden with clich√©s but at least they got one thing right the ethnic representations. Despite the history this should be only side show and concentrated on an adventure story without Rasputin as an antagonist going to much in to fantasy. Another flaw with this film is that it follows a judgemental pattern when discussing the Tsar who is always viewed as a Martyr in the Western media and the Anastasia myth is one that compels people to say that the Communists criminals lost and the innocent Tsar did not die in vain. In reality the Tsar was a weak ruler with an arrogant wife who lived in luxury whilst his people starved and kept his people back with medieval practices. Defenders of his will always point to the Duma however this was only a representative the Tsar still had absolute power no matter how many able rulers came before Nicholas II - absolute responsibility who paid the absolute price. Because the order that replaced him was Socialist that the Tsar is revered in cinema as the October revolution gave the Capitalist system a run for its money through out the 20th century but then I must be a hypocrite to deny American Cold war aggression and policy which is what its all about.',\n",

But it's a counterproductive sport, the training is interesting but the real job brings you only physical and brain damage, as the guide says ''You will be literally dying''. They say they died climbing the Everest, in fact, about 70% died in the ''descent''. Some stats about the death rate of...'descending' the big mountains: ANAPURNA = 41%, K2 = 32% and EVEREST = 25% (they say 1 out of 4 in the film, but the stats in Matador Network are more around 20%). Alternative: Russian roulette, only 8%. Do you realize it's 500% safer than trying Anapurna. OK I know, 1 out of 6 is only 16% but only 50% +- of the 'players' died.

What I found irritating about htis movie though, was its portrayal of the \"female general\" of Persia. She is actually a Greek who was raped and enslaved and tortured by the Greeks a s a child. Then she somehow, becomes the most feared warrior in Persia? I don\\'t buy that. This is just a social justice commentary by cultural-marxists. It may be also just a reflection of the over-feminized, politically-correct Western Film world. Seriously? The penultimate statement in the movie, is when The Female General, curses Xerxes by saying how \" he only has his safety because of her army\\'s protection.\" Lulz. This is the exact opposite of reality of war and the roles of males and females. It\\'s actually the feminists of the West who have the freedom to disparage men and the value of men only because of the millions of male sacrifices of war and battle.

              " \"This wry, subversive and amusing take on the American family and child beauty contests is 100 minutes of sheer enjoyment. It's also proof of the saying that good art does not come from nowhere. The directors, husband and wife team Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris, have never made a feature movie before, yet have had 20 years experience making commercials and MTV programs. There is no really big-name star but the actors are mostly very experienced (and well chosen) - even 9 year old Abigail Breslin as Olive is an experienced child actor. The production history was convoluted and the picture came very close to not being made on several occasions. The result is an almost perfectly realized comedy with hardly a surplus line which leaves a warm afterglow in audiences.There were dysfunctional fictional American families before the Hoovers and the Hoovers themselves are not particularly freaky. It's actually seven-year old Olive who wants to be a beauty queen. Mum (Tony Collette) is pre-occupied with the welfare of her brother Frank (Steve Carell) a Proust scholar who recently attempted suicide after losing his lover and his job. Dad (Greg Kinnear), a struggling motivational counseller, doesn't spot Olive on his emotional radar until he sees her as a way of proving the effectiveness of his nine-points to success program. Crude old Grandpa (Alan Arkin) is supportive, and does some coaching, in between snorting heroin. Teenage brother Dwayne (Paul Dano), aspiring USAF pilot immersed in a Nietzschean silence, is an unwilling passenger on the VW Microbus to the grand contest at Redondo Beach, California. So we have a family comedy, a road movie, and a sharp dig at the American obsessions with youth and success, not to mention the authoritarian bureaucracies that infest the land of the free.Despite the fun in getting there, via the interstates, gas stations and highway patrols, the climax of the movie is undoubtedly the pre-teen beauty pageant. Here the directors managed to persuade real contestants in real such contests to do their stuff, and some of it is frighteningly professional \\x96 at least one gymnastic act by an 8 year old would qualify for the Olympics. Olive's act is not in the same class, but she brings the house down nonetheless, to the great discomfort of officialdom. Needless to say she doesn't win, but the family walks (or rather runs) away together, more united than before.Pre-teen beauty contests are an ugly business and the murder case of Jo-Benet Ramsay was a reminder of the unwholesomeness of it all, but the film-makers here play it straight \\x96 what you see is what the fans get - and you can form your own view about what these contests tell you about American popular culture and mores. But you needn't worry about the message \\x96 there are enough pure laughs here to justify the price of admission.\",\n",

This movie alternates between insufferable, back-aching boredom to frenetic, hold-on-to-your-seat action. And most of the action sequences are amazing. It's probably worth the price of admission just to see the action sequences and Ledger's performance.It does not surprise me that this movie had FIVE WRITERS. I knew this half way through the movie before I even looked it up. How did I know this sitting in the movie? Four things will tip you off to multiple writers in a movie. (1) Haphazard, rambling direction. (2) Storyline on top of storyline on top of storyline. (3) The movie ends FIVE TIMES (one for each writer). (4) More than two hour running time (this movie is almost three hours -- remember the mess that was Spiderman 3??).From the very beginning, this movie seems to have no direction whatsoever. You could literally take the script to this movie and divide each scene up on separate sheets of paper, throw them up in the air, gather them up and shoot this movie again and nothing would change. That's how disorganized and haphazard the story proceeds. There are at least five side-stories, all of which are hard to follow and difficult to understand how they fit in to the overall story (blowing up two ferries?).BY FAR the most annoying part of The Dark Knight is Christian Bale's unbelievably over-the-top, angst-ridden portrayal of Batman. As Bruce Wayne, he delivers a great performance. When he straps on the gear, he becomes this growling, hilariously overwrought caricature of the Batman we know and love. He had people in my theater LAUGHING when he talked. It's a ridiculous performance and it's the director's fault.And, who is the annoying basset hound playing Rachel? Horrible actress. Not even remotely hot. I never thought I'd miss Katie Holmes.I'd rather see Iron Man fifty times before seeing this again.But don't let that keep you from seeing the movie.

Other than the \"goodbye, Love\" and \"Halloween\" that a previous poster mentioned, they also did not include \"Contact\". I was a little disappointed, since I was curious how the director would handle the sex scene, but the route he chose was fantastic nonetheless.The acting was superb. Rosario Dawson (Mimi) totally exceeded my expectations, and I was thrilled to see so much of the original cast in the film. everyone did a wonderful job, and I was moved to tears more than once, laughed out loud a few times, and quietly sang along with some of the more memorable tunes.The only people in the theater that did not seem to enjoy it, were a couple of teenage boys that probably had no clue it was even a musical, or dealt with homosexual relationships and AIDS, and whatnot.

Essentially, this is more a continuance of the original series rather than a complete rehash (which is also what I expected). First, big kudos to Kevin Spacey, who gives a more accurate Lex Luthor than Gene Hackman ever did (not to mention funnier). Second, the new Superman pretty much holds his own against Christopher Reeve's portrayal, with a little more goofiness as Clark. Everyone else pretty much did a great job.However, one noticeable improvement over the first 4: the effects. I recently saw Superman 3, and looking at the effects now, they were pretty lame (good for their time, though). We all know CGI has come a long way, and let's face it: looking back at the first 4, while technological marvels of their time, they were not the most convincing things. So the effects would be like comparing the Harryhausen dinosaurs from King Kong to the CGI dinosaurs from Jurassic Park. Similarly, the effects help propel the story.Only negative comment: it is long--2.5 hours at my count (see IMDb for more accurate timing), which made the film drag at times, but otherwise, great popcorn flick.\",\n",

Am not surprised at all its award wins and nominations (including being a record breaker at the Golden Globes), and if it does well at the Oscars as well there will be no complaints from me.'La La Land' clicked with me most likely because of my love for golden age Hollywood, musicals (a somewhat maligned genre these days, but while there are a fair share of not particularly good ones there are a bigger number of great ones and even masterpieces), and how it fondly reminded me of what makes me love them so much. Also because of being able to relate to its themes and conflicts, due to being there myself. The talent was also appetising, starring Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone, directed by 'Whiplash's' Damien Chazelle and featuring cameo support from JK Simmons (who coincidentally won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for 'Whiplash), John Legend and Rosemarie DeWitt.It was just sheer joy to see a film with so much potential deliver on that potential and even more so, having seen a lot of stuff recently film and TV that wasted their potential it was refreshing to see a film actually delivering on it.Visually, 'La La Land' is a gorgeous-looking film, with lots of vibrant colour that leap out at you from the screen while not having too much of a dizzying effect and cinematography that's not just a dream to behold but inventively done without falling into self-indulgent territory. The music and songs may induce, and has induced, mixed reactions, count me in as somebody who found the songs infectious, emotion-filled and with enough to make one top-tap and hum along.The musical numbers are winningly choreographed too with non-stop exuberance. The opening number is especially true to this. The script is warm, funny, affectionate and poignant, and also with an honesty. It's not a complex script, nor did it need to be, and neither does it make the mistake of being too simple. The story is admittedly slight in places, then again so were the stories of even the best golden age musicals and they still managed to be classics because of how everything else was executed and because of the atmosphere.Something that is true with 'La La Land', a film where anybody can relate to its themes. Even more special though is that not only does it pay tribute to musicals and films of the golden age (especially those with MGM), with their bold colour, exuberant marriage of music and dance, it also has a winsomeness and melancholic nature seen in films like 'The Umbrellas of Cherbourg' yet does it in a way that will appeal hugely to modern audiences. Loved that the two leads' relationship and chemistry was much more complex than the love-at-first-sight sort (far from it, more antagonists turned lovers) with a meet cute first encounter (again also not a case).Chazelle's direction shows someone with a sheer love for film and film-making, more than evident in execution that is affectionate and full-of-life rather than self-indulgent. The chemistry between the two leads and their performances would need to be good to make the film work. No worries there. Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone look so natural and at ease together, nothing looks false and it is easy to root for them and their conflicts.Both of them give terrific performances, performances so good that less than great singing was immediately forgotten about. Especially Stone who has never been better in a performance of great expressivity and nuance, so many emotions such as vulnerability, strength, cheekiness, charm and buoyancy with never a hint of a heavy-handed touch. Gosling matches her, if not quite as good, showing a very charismatic presence and an effortless twinkling charm. All the support, although basically cameos, registers memorably.All in all, a dream come true and totally banishes any blues and daily troubles away. 10/10 Bethany Cox\",\n",

              " 'In comparison to the original trilogy, \"On Stranger Tides\" is less inventive, less funny and less impressive. However it still has a few strengths that makes it worth watching.Pros:The plot, as always, is great - simple enough to understand, but complex enough to be fascinating. Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) is conscripted onto the Queen Anne\\'s Revenge, captained by Blackbeard (Ian McShane), where he meets his past love Angelica (Pen√©lope Cruz). They sail for the Fountain of Youth in a race against Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush), as well as the Spanish. There\\'s plenty of action, with which the mythology and legends are interwoven wonderfully.The cinematography, special effects, costuming and design elements are beautiful, just like the original trilogy. They make \"On Stranger Tides\" a cohesive movie, and ensure that the world of the movie is rich, deep and convincing. Hans Zimmer, again, delivers an amazing soundtrack that complements the story perfectly.Cons:The movie takes itself too seriously at times, especially with the romance between Philip (Sam Claflin) the clergyman and Syrena (Astrid Berg√®s- Frisbey) the mermaid. It seems forced and superficial, and the lines exchanged between them are always over-dramatic. Also, Barbossa\\'s super- serious revenge story is boring, washed-out and clich√©d. This comes as a great disappointment because Barbossa\\'s character was hilariously outrageous in the original trilogy.Which brings me to another point. The humour in this movie was really lacking. There were many moments in the original trilogy where I laughed so hard I cried - Jack\\'s experiences on the cannibal island, the fight on the wheel, Jack and Barbossa arguing over captaincy - but there were no really memorable moments in this instalment. The \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" franchise has always been special because of its absurdity, but this movie just doesn\\'t live up to it.I wish I could say that Johnny Depp\\'s performance as Jack Sparrow carried the movie for me, but it really didn\\'t. Depp is a great actor but his lines just lack the wit and cleverness that really characterised Jack in the first three movies, and he also lacks swagger. In the original trilogy, Jack\\'s brilliance always came from the way he played everyone for his own benefit, and we don\\'t really see much of that in \"On Stranger Tides\". His willingness to sacrifice for Angelica undermines his every-man-for-himself nature that made him so likable.Blackbeard and Angelica\\'s stories lack conviction. She wants to save him because she wants a father figure she\\'s never had - this seems like a very pathetic excuse for sailing to the Fountain of Youth. The best villains are either the ones you love, hate or fear, and Blackbeard fits into none of those categories. In the end I felt nothing towards either of them.The plot twists in this movie are quite predictable. There was not one surprising moment. The original trilogy was ridiculous and unpredictable and left me wondering what was going to happen next, but \"On Stranger Tides\" is filled with clich√©s and shoddy writing that made it lack suspense.Overall, \"Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides\" is a mediocre movie that is nowhere near as good as the original trilogy, but is still worth watching because of its interesting premise, the nice action scenes, and Richard Griffiths\\'s cameo as King George.',\n",
              " 'After just seeing Magnolia a day ago I find it very hard to believe the average rating on this film is 8.2. I have no explanation as to why so many people would find this movie well done let alone worth sitting through three hours for. Don\\'t get me wrong this movie had a hell of a lot of potential but stringing together a plot line of 10 characters who need a serious kick in the pants for them to complete a coherent thought just completely ruined it for me. This brings me to another point. I foresee this movie becoming one of those films that people like because they are \"supposed\" to like. NO! This is not a culturing, artistic experience. It is a film that makes you dooped, dooped into sitting through something for three hours, three hours of film which should have seen nothing but the editing room\\'s floor.',\n",
              " 'When telling a friend to go see Little Miss Sunshine, it is really hard to convince them to see it simply because of the plot, because it is kind of contrived and has that done-before feeling. What makes the movie is it\\'s wonderfully flawed, colorful characters, and the tremendous writing, and the ability to keep humor in a potentially tragic moment.In the first five minutes of the movie, we meet all of the characters. We first meet Olive (adorable little Abigail Breslin) glaring at the audience. We soon find out that she\\'s watching old beauty pageant videos, and practicing her reaction to when she finally wins the Little Miss Sunshine pageant. Next, we meet her father, Richard, played by Greg Kinnear, who\\'s done some of his best work in 2006. His character, Richard is an inspirational speaker, whose \"Nine Steps To Success\" have brought him very little success. Then we meet Olive\\'s teenage brother Dwayne, played by Paul Dano, whose performance might be the best one in the movie. His character reminds me of myself in my teenage years, and the way he plays it is just to die for. Dwayne hasn\\'t spoken a word in nine months because he\\'s taken a vow of silence until he becomes a test pilot in the Air Force Academy.Then we meet the grandpa, played by Alan Arkin. In his first scene, he is showed snorting heroin, and we soon find out that he got kicked out of his retirement home for his outrageous behavior. Arkin is very, very funny in this movie, and his performance is not to be missed. And then we meet Sheryl, played by Toni Collette. She is terrific in the part, although there isn\\'t enough of her in the movie. She plays Olive and Dwayne\\'s frazzled mom who is just trying to do the best for her children. That\\'s pretty much all there is to her character. And last we meet Sheryl\\'s gay suicidal brother Frank, who tried to off himself after being dumped by his lover. In a nearly 20-minute scene at a dinner table where the family eats fast-food fried chicken, we learn everything about the Hoover family dynamic. And then we listen to a message from Sheryl\\'s sister, telling Olive that there\\'s a place for her in the Little Miss Sunshine beauty pageant, and after some initial hesitation...road trip! I really can\\'t tell you about all of the priceless comedy that goes down on the way from Albuquerque to Redondo Beach, because I couldn\\'t possibly ruin the wonderful and twisted laughs in this movie. In conclusion, it\\'s the funniest movie I\\'ve seen in years, and possibly the funniest movie I\\'ll see in a long time. So, you shouldn\\'t make the mistake to rent this wonderful piece of cinema, you should go buy this movie right away.',\n",
              " \"All in all I think this movie was average. The beginning of the movie was pretty slow until it got to the end. It was interesting, and the storyline was good, but it was somewhat lacking. I love Edward Norton, he's a great actor and my favorite, but I definitely think he's done much better. I do have to give him credit though, it's been awhile since he's been on screen and also for doing this sort of romance type of movie. If I could tell anyone one thing, it would be to wait until this movie comes out on DVD to watch it. It's a great movie, but I think it goes more toward the more mature, patient type of audience. The ending is really great though and I was really impressed with it.\",\n",

Regrettably, they weren\\'t met.There\\'s plenty of good here, but unfortunately there\\'s even more so-so. Overall, \"Almost Famous\" comes across as a 2-hour sitcom. A pretty decent one, to be fair, but I simply never bought into the genuineness of this band, its people and their emotions. Even their fights play like something out of \\'That \\'70s Show\\' and the big \\'revelation\\' plane scene is embarrassingly hammy, all of which makes it really difficult to take this as an organic story. Too many times it seems like a high budget, major studio dress-up.',\n",

An adventure filled with magic, werewolves and vampires ensues.WHAT WE DO IN THE SHADOWS is one of the funniest movies I've seen since quite a while. The characters are plain hilarious, and each one is unique and also relatable. The characters are essentially just hyper-clich√©d stereotypes, such as the German pedantic vampire with a penchant for organizing his friends' lives, or the sex crazed vampire master with a craving for torture. Yet, despite being such stereotypes, each character is quite believable\\x97in part achieved through the great (and hilarious) performances.The movie exudes a sense of play and joy. It certainly doesn't take itself too seriously, but it's also not too silly to be dumb. A comedy like this falls or rises with the wittiness of its jokes and in this one, all the jokes are spot on.

              " \"Spielberg! Tom Cruise!! A tried-and-true sci-fi classic by H. G. Wells!!! Together they should add up to a great summer popcorn movie, but here's how to squander a golden opportunity by making all the wrong choices: Make sure there isn't a single sympathetic human character in the entire film, so that we'll be sure to root for the Martians (or whatever they are). Make your central family so quarrelsome, incurious, irrational, and just plain annoying that we long to escape from their company -- and then force us to spend the entire movie seeing all the events through their eyes. Let Tom Cruise bicker with his teenage son in a tedious sitcom way while civilization is crumbling around them and hundreds of people are being vaporized. Encourage Dakota Fanning to scream, scream, scream throughout the entire film so that we can savor the joy of having a little kid screaming shrilly in our ears. Take a heart-meltingly beautiful actress like Miranda Otto and make her pregnant so that she looks pudgy and matronly -- and since she's the Mother Figure, don't give her anything interesting to do. Have human beings -- who might be expected to scatter and flee at giant killer tripods -- crowd together and gaze up at these lethal 200-foot-tall machines with a dumb awestruck wonder approaching zombiehood (even a herd of sheep would display more survival skills). In particular, at the first sight of the first alien war machine thrusting up from the pavement somewhere in Queens, NY, have your multiethnic crowds assemble around the widening hole just inches from the edge and peer inside, even as the sidewalk begins to crack and buildings around them fall to pieces. Give the hero a Quest, a Goal, that's really dumb and just this side of pointless -- in this case, somehow getting himself and his two kids from NYC to Boston, where his ex-wife is -- but don't reveal how he manages, improbably, to get there, and don't let us know why he assumes she (or anyone in Boston, for that matter) would still be alive. Don't give any other human beings any direction or motivation at all, but instead just show them shuffling like refugees down roads, bound God knows where, or fleeing together in a panic -- for no logical reason -- onto a ferry boat which has no chance of getting away and no particular safe place to go. Wherever humans are, have them congregate in groups so that the lethal tripods can pick them off and slaughter them more easily. Have the motivation and intentions of the aliens themselves remain thoroughly obscure: At first, when they presumably want to rid the earth of mankind, don't have them use poison gas (as I seem to recall Wells did), but instead let them content themselves with firing death rays, like target practice, at individual fleeing humans -- the most inefficient method of extermination imaginable. Then, midway through, suggest that -- for no particular reason -- the aliens are vampires who seek human blood. When all of metropolitan New York, or perhaps the whole East Coast, is plunged in a blackout, have the hero and his family reach an unnamed suburb at nighttime where, miraculously, the one house they're seeking is flooded with light: the only house on the street, standing empty but with every light inexplicably burning (and no other humans around to investigate). Have the hero be a derrick operator and presumably something of a technical expert, but don't use any of his expertise during the course of the story. While the eponymous War is raging, don't use the benefits of modern computer graphics to show us what's interesting (such as a battle between the Air Force and the aliens); keep the action for what seems a quarter of the film confined to a couple of basements, so that, claustrophobically, we feel as if we're watching a low-budget three-person stage play with all the action going on -- unseen -- outside the windows. Whenever possible show humans screaming, despairing, panicking, and fighting among themselves -- never cooperating or displaying any ingenuity. Take the one potentially interesting, sympathetic character (Tim Robbins), the one character who has a dream, however crackbrained, of resistance to the invaders, and quickly turn him into a loony that will engage Cruise in a fight to the death. When, in the time-tested Spielberg manner, you have the Family Reunited At The End, stage the scene in such a hokey, amateurish, improbable way that the audience around me laughed derisively.\",\n",
              " \"I remember being so excited when this movie came out. My parents thought that the first two Indiana Jones movies were too violent for me so I never got to see them in the theater. But at 14 I was finally deemed old enough for Dr. Jones.At 14 I also remember, shall we say, youthful naivete about movie conventions. When Indy went over the cliff near the end, I thought that he was actually dead. Had I first seen this movie as an adult, I no doubt would have said to myself that he'd be climbing back up any moment.Last Crusade loses a little bit of its luster as an adult viewer. Although the interplay between Ford and Connery is often very funny, I'm not sure that the character or the story called for the added depth of the whole Spielberg estranged father thing. It feels a bit tacked on, as if Spielberg wanted it there just because that's his thing. It doesn't necessarily detract from the story, but I'm not sure if it needed to be there. Indiana Jones movies aren't really about depth of character. This is more of an observation than a criticism though. Last Crusade is still a wild and fun ride.\",\n",

I vaguely remembered something about vampires being in the movie, but as the film began, I thought my memory must've been wrong, because this was a movie about two bankrobbers/murderers named the Gecko brothers, Clooney (Excellent as an anti-hero character) and Tarantino (not as excellent).The first half hour is quite good, thanks to Tarantino's great script and solid acting by Clooney and his hostage Keitel, a preacher with two children who has lost his faith due to the death of his wife. After they cross the border into Mexico to avoid the police and FBI, they go to a not so family-friendly bar to meet their accomplice in the robberies.Then the entire movie falls apart.It turns out that all of the people that work in the bar are secretly vampires, and an ultra-gory biting and stabbing scene follows, complete with decapitating and removing beating hearts.Now don't get me wrong, there are some well choreographed vampire fight scenes in this movie that can be attributed to director Rodriguez, but the transition between the Gecko Brothers escaping to the vampire hunting is so choppy that it feels like two completely different movies just crammed together. After the movie was over, my friend and I both agreed it was one of the dumbest movies we had ever seen and were both severely disappointed.

Their servants have disappeared into thin air and Grace\\'s husband is lost at war. Then one day three strangers show up at their door. Mrs. Mills being the leader (Fionulla Flanigan) along with the gardener (Erik Sykes) and a mute girl, Lydia (Elaine Casasidy). Nicole needs the help so she hires them on the spot. She shows them the kids, Anne and Nicholas (Alakina Mann and James Bentley). The two have a rare disease that makes them break out in blisters and sores whenever light hits them. So atall time everyone must follow the simple rules. No door can be opened until the one you just walked through is locked and make sure all curtains are closed.Soon enough strange things start to happen. Curtains open in the middle of the nights, crying is heard from someone who doesn\\'t seem to be anywhere in the house, whispering is heard aswell as the piano being played inside the locked room when everyone is in bed. Could the house be haunted? Anne seems to think so. She claims to of seen them. There\\'s Victor, a young boy, aswell as a mother and father and an old woman.Grace wont have a bar of it but she does start to suspect something but instead of the paranormal... she suspects the servents. And rightly so, they are damned creepy.Anyway. Along the way Grace\\'s husband returns (played by Chris Eccleson) from war and the kids discover something sinister about the new servants.The movie is expertly made. Great performances by all involved (Nicole Kidman, Fionulla Flanigan and Alakina Mann being the standouts. I would love to see Nicole get an oscar for this but I liked Moulin Rouge more. A Supporting Actress nod could go the way of Fionulla or Alakina (Remember Anna Paquin got one when she was young!)). Alajandro Amenabar has created a world of haunting beauty. The interior scenes all have a great atmosphere and the rare outside scenes are given a wonderful touch or mystery by the surprisingly eerie use of fog). The directing, writing, cinematography, set design et cetera are all top notch.The ending is great. I never saw it coming. The subtle clues Alajandro gives us are good enough as to not give away the ending but to make us think whether what\\'s happening is real/fake/imagined or possibly even a big nightmare (the movie starts with Grace waking up from a nightmare, screaming).Oh and there is some scary stuff going on in this film. We don\\'t get scared anymore by the latest whiz-bang special effects (see Lost Souls, House On Haunted Hill) but Alajandro creates a sense of fear from what he are thinking. Take for example the scene where everyone in the house is asleep and then the downstairs piano in the locked room starts playing. We are unsure what is going on but we are all know something is going to happen and we get scared by that feeling. Special notice must go to the end scare with the kids in the closet... everyone in my cinema (600 people) jumped/screamed/curses/covered their eyes... everyone was caught by surprise.10/10 A+-SPOILERS ABOUT THE ENDING FROM NOW-\\nThe movie\\'s ending, which has been called a rip-off of The Sixth Sense, is actually a lot better than that movie\\'s ending.

              " 'This is the one that set the bar very high for those movies to follow...After so many years, Alien grabs you right from the beginning. Casting was superb, special effects were way out there perfect, and the story simply could not be improved upon...The space commercial tug Nostromo, on it\\'s way back from a stint of \"mineral mining\" operations, is tasked by the \"company\" to investigate a strange alien signal sent out from a planet not far from the tugs course. The crew is comprised of a Captain, First officer, two interestingly rebellious engineers, a planetary engineer, and a strange crew member who apparently is the ships medical Doctor, but later turns out to be a sinister company android.I won\\'t go through the whole screenplay, but this movie was written with the twists and turns of Twilight Zone in mind, it is that good...One thing that amazed me over the years is the incredible detail put forth in the models of both the tug Nostromo, and the complete mining and processing platform it is towing. The exterior and interior shots of the space tug is quite simply \"believable\". It looks like a completely utilitarian workhorse, as it should. You could literally close your eyes and imagine being a crew member in the far future...Alien is the mark that all space operas must live up to now...',\n",
              " 'I simply want to weigh in with a very positive response to Enemy at the Gates. Taken as a historical drama rather than an attempt to flawlessly depict an historical incident, this is topnotch entertainment. \"Enemy\" portrays the conflict between a young Russian sniper played by Law and the German sniper (Harris) who is sent to kill him during the German attack on Stalingrad during WWII. Apart from a scene which awkwardly caricatures the Russian field commanders and the occasionally distracting accents, the film successfully immerses the viewer in this tense war drama. Appreciate it it for its tight focus, uncompromising realism, and fine characterizations by the main actors. Research the historical accuracy later, if you must, but don\\'t let it spoil the film.',\n",

'The Dark Knight' is a treat for a cinema lover, I was gripped, Stunned and Amused to see such a great film. Its the highest grossing film after Titanic, in my opinion it deserves to be at no.1.Performance Wise: Heath Ledger will live through his portrayal as The Joker. Giving him any award, can not be as high as his performance. He's fantastic. The best performance delivered in the History of Cinema. Bale as Batman rocks. Aaron is outstanding as Harvery Dent and even as the short-lived two-face. Maggie is good. Sir Michael Caine is amazing as Alfred. Gary Oldman is a legend, he's fab. Morgan Freeman is tremendous. Others also excel.'The Dark Knight' is one of the best film ever made. Cinema is proud to have a film like The Dark Knight. Two Thumbs Up!\",\n",
              " 'The main actor voice is narrator to tell story about him, so the movie focuses on the story of the main actor. Besides, his voice sometimes describes what he is thinking. It makes the audience more understand the feeling of the character and makes the movie run more smoothly. Moreover, the background musics are very suitable with the scenes and the feeling; for example, the scene that the main actor came back from the party and went to see the main actress; the background music performed and stopped few seconds after the main actor said happy new year. In addition, the scene that the main actress did a joke to be \"Charly\" is very enjoyable with performing the background music. Finally, it is very weird to have the main actor voice after he died, and definitely the last scene that the main actress walked down from the stair like princess is very interesting the end scene that I have watched movie.',\n",

We are NOTHING to system, but it can not work without us, so we have rights (and must have strength and will) to overpower system and make it work for OUR purposes. This is how i understood the idea of the Fight Club. I support idea, but i don't support methods of it realization.

It focuses on the emotions inside her head as they try to keep her life in check. The main emotion is joy played by amy poehler and she is really good. The character is allot of fun and always full of energy, during the film her character really does develop into an interesting character. The rest of the emotions are great as well with sadness, disgust and fear being portrayed very well. But the stand out is definitely anger, he is just so funny and steals the show with how entertaining he is. The story is way deeper then you would expect with the film giving a deep message to children. It also has the fun adventure that children need. The script has allot of great humour that will leave you laughing. But it also has great drama that really makes it a fantastic film. The style is great, with the animation looking really good and allowing the personality of the film to shine. Overall this is a must see for kids and adults alike.',\n",

Now I admit its not perfect but we do not live in a perfect world either, so please cut me the crap and start thinking in waves and not straight !First time I saw it tears came down (seriously I sort of cried) but they were tears of happiness. First of all it came out when Hollywood was making all sorts of messes out of Transformers so for me this was a sigh of relief to know that someone out there can still make a good robot movie that is not a cartoon. Second, it blends with anything that is a good old robot movie ! You got the nice cute guys, the pain in the butt warriors, world coming together, monsters and the great 2 crazy professors that are basically in all Japanese robot TV series !!! Third, and this is what many reviewers need to understand before BLA BLA BLA come out of their fingers onto the keyboard, is that this is Hollywood stuff and in Hollywood there are people trained to ruin movies with love stories and creating problems where probably they might not exist. But come on ... the rest fits perfectly in place.One thing pisses me off ... what is an old computer monitor doing in this movie ???????? That could have been avoided.',\n",
              " \"*potential minor spoilers mentioned!*To think that it has been three years since we last saw the Avengers assembled in the midst of battle is quite something. Now in 2015, we have been treated with the follow-up Age Of Ultron, in which the team have to overcome an intimidating threat in the formidable foe Ultron, a creation of Tony Stark, in order to prevent or rather at least minimise any threat. However, something goes wrong and instead Ultron is created and aims to impose vengeance on the team. James Spader does a splendid job as the villain, using his own voice to really capture that sense of Ultron being something with life, and not just any simple,lifeless robot. However, as the film moves on from his introduction and other plots are looked at (which I cannot mention without necessarily spoiling), I personally lost interest in him and wanted to see the development of the other arcs. In doing so, I guess you could say it is leading on to future films and to be fair the film has got me excited for next years Captain America Civil War, but at some points it felt like too much was going on and being crammed in for the sole purpose of the development of future plots.One small aspect of the film that I didn't quite like is that it starts off with the whole team in battle, fighting together, which seems to entirely forget previous character arcs in other films such as Tony Stark's retirement in Iron Man 3, but regardless it was a great action packed opening. Speaking the action, the crew seemed to have upped the ante and each character has their stand out moments, which is definitely something director Joss Whedon set out to do, after some fans anger regarding the way in which Hawkeye was used in The Avengers. Don't worry, this time he has plenty of screen time to show off his bow and arrow skills! Overall, the film retains it's franchise now trademark sense of humour, epic action and all- round-fun. The dynamic interaction between the heroes is fantastic and if anything has just got me excited to see how the Justice League team are portrayed together. Now, in terms of where I would put it on my list of the best Marvel films, I would consider it to be below The Winter Soldier and below The Avengers, but that's expected because TWS is a film devoted to one of the heroes and the Avengers was the first time we saw the characters fighting together. My personal gripe is that for me, Marvel have yet to create a villain on the big screen that really stands out and is developed well, like some of the DC villains we have seen and I would still argue that we haven't seen that yet. Something like the Kingpin from the exceptional Marvel TV show, Daredevil is what they need. I guess that's what we'll being seeing as the Avengers face Thanos in upcoming the Infinity War films. Bring it on is all I say.\",\n",
              " 'Even though we\\'re convinced that a beauty like Grace Kelly won\\'t actually ever hang for a murder she didn\\'t commit, this is a fascinating flick, anyhow. Almost all of it takes place in only one setting - Margot\\'s & Tony\\'s small but classy apartment. Evil Is Interesting: we\\'re enthralled by Tony\\'s (Ray Milland\\'s) evolving plot to murder his adulterous wife. Tony is even seen as somewhat justified, since Margot is adultering with a younger, handsomer man, Mark, as played somewhat limply by Bob Cummings. Margot\\'s affair may be acceptable continental behavior, but it\\'s grounds for a man to seek violent forms of \"satifaction\" in solidly-Anglo-Saxon Britain. Tony is a professional murder-mystery-writer, so we the audience root for a fool-proof scheme out of this guy, but just in the backs of our minds. The players are set into motion! The proxy murderer enters the house with Margot there alone! Tony is across town enjoying his well-thought-out air-tight alibi! Mark isn\\'t in a position to save her! Then, Tony\\'s plot fails! Margo physically turns tables on the man set to kill her, smalltime crook Swan. The tension in the murder-room, with Margot struggling while being strangled, then killing her attacker is all thanks to a well-placed common household gadget! Tony\\'s plot fails, interestingly enough, but his wife may be put to death my His Majesty\\'s Government thanks to a plot twist. WONDERFUL, Tony thinks. It could all end there, with perhaps Margot getting a commutation to life imprisonment or something, so we don\\'t feel so bad for her. But, Hitchcock and the author both work skillfully to fool us. The Fat Lady will sing later. Inspector Hubbard, of Scotland Yard, played by the comfortably-English and familiar John Williams, has these attacks of conscience and must \"get to the bottom of things\". Altho his unfaithful wife is now safely on death row, Tony finds a Brit version of Columbo keeps showing up to bother him with little details. Egged on by Margot\\'s old boyfriend Mark, Insp Hubbard, who first helped send Margot up the river, delves even deeper into the case. Using relentless logic, Hubbard drives events forward to their logical conclusion, as we see Tony falling to pieces mentally, a bit at a time. The script is brilliant in several aspects, mostly for introducing murder-plan elements that first confuse the audience. As these puzzlements are solved, a new perplexity comes into play, and we don\\'t understand Hubbard\\'s crime-solving method until the very end. There\\'s no mystery about who did what, but there is a great deal of mystery about how the bad guy is going to get caught! So, this filmplay is done quite smartly.',\n",

              " \"If you've seen the trailer for this picture, you've seen the whole thing. Total Recall is an arduous movie to sit through because it's exactly the movie you're expecting to see. It does absolutely nothing outside the standard action movie dynamic, interspersing ridiculous CGI action sequences with statically shot expository dialogue scenes. It's a terribly frustrating experience as you feel the timer tick down to the next explosion while the characters bounce their clunky dialogue off each other. There are five people credited with the screenplay and story for this movie, which is far more hilarious than any comedy to come out in 2012.The movie takes its time to get going, but this can probably be put down to the extended edition tag. It feels like the cinematic cut would have been a solid half an hour shorter. Farrell is shown to be a man working in a factory (with a very cool apartment and one of the most beautiful women in the world as a wife) who wants more for some reason. So, he goes to Rekall, which is the only real connection to the movie's name, to spice things up by getting some fake memories injected into his brain. Not only is this just a clumsy device to set up the plot of the movie, it actually never gets mentioned again. This movie could have been called one of a thousand crummy titles, but jumps on the reboot bandwagon to boost opening weekend ticket sales. The action kicks off when it turns out that Farrell doesn't need to pretend to be a spy because he is one already. From there on in it's a series of mindless CGI explosions and poorly-written dialogue scenes that advance the plot to the next action set-piece before we get to the final big fight, which the good guy wins. Absolutely no tension, significant character development or any degree of cinematic finesse.To his credit, Farrell gives it his all and his quality as an actor shows as he brings a little bit of life to the stale script and dull action. Beckinsale does her job of looking amazing with a gun in her hand, chasing Farrell through various video game levels, but her and Biel (who looks downright plain next to Beckinsale) are never given enough time or attention to ever be more than pretty faces. Easily the most talented actors on the screen, Bryan Cranston (Breaking Bad) and Bill Nighy (Love Actually, Harry Potter, Pirates of the Caribbean), have about five minutes of screen time between them. Nighy's lines are almost obscured by the dial tone of his phoned-in performance and while Cranston gets in and out with as little fuss as possible. The acting is probably the best part of this film, but that doesn't say much.Visually, Total Recall is pretty unspectacular. A lesser director would have filmed the whole movie on a green screen and Wiseman deserves credit for making sure there were a few sets here and there, but not much else. Overall, heavy reliance on CGI to create the sci-fi world the story takes place in robs the movie of what little humanity it had and the final sequence with Biel in the gunship on the landing pad while Farrell fights the robot is directly stolen from Raiders of the Lost Ark. Not influenced by. A shameless rip-off of. Lazy direction is one thing, trying to con the audience into enjoying themselves by abducting a familiar sequence from a superior film is another.There are certainly better ways to spend 125 million dollars, but movies like this need to be made to keep stupid people entertained and those of us who know better hungry for a movie of quality. Total Recall is only really memorable for its flaws, which there are many, and should be viewed with that in mind.goodbadreviews.wordpress.com\",\n",
              " \"Gotta say, a lot of the reviews here are complaining about how ludicrous or unbelievable it is... but I think they may be missing the point.The plot is comedy. They are assassins, but married with no idea about the other's secret lives. And their marriage is failing. So, when they're booked in to kill each other, it's easier for them to take the job on.Perhaps, it turns out, that part of the reason their marriage is failing is because it was built on lies... which they reveal to each other over time as they become closer.The shooting, the ridiculous ability to fend off hundreds of people booked in to kill them is just comedy. It's not even close to realistic. But it's not about that. It's about their relationship in a ridiculous setting.Like Grosse Point Blank turned up to 111. It's stupid. It's meant to be. It's a ridiculous situation as the canvas for a light hearted, and funny love story.If you're looking for high scale edgy Hollywood action, you'll be disappointed. If you just want to be entertained, and honestly, in a way, aside from the super-tomb-raider hundred perfect shots and their ability to overcome obscene weights of a million bullets with apparent ease, I thought it was kinda charming. Their chemistry is off the scale. It's a love story, with bullets, instead of awkward silences over dinner and unanswered emails raising uncertainty about if they were good enough on their last date or some other Meg Ryan shiz.\",\n",
              " 'I think I\\'ve been a fan of twilight for about two years. I read all three books in less than a week, and I and a few of my friends attended the release of the fourth book in the Twilight series. It was about that time when I realized the many flaws in the books. They are too numerous to write about at the moment, because my main focus is the movie. I had long awaited the movie, for almost an entire year. I was so excited, I found out one of my favorite actors was going to be cast as the main character, and I, along with many other twilight fans, eagerly waited as each character was cast. The hype for the movie was phenomenal. Everyone was talking about it, twilight fans, people who hated the books, people who never even read the books. Good Morning America had a special about the movie; there were trailers all over Myspace, you couldn\\'t check your email with out some story about Twilight flashed in your face. It was supposed to be the Action/Romance/Thriller of the year. It wasn\\'t. Let\\'s start with the actors. The character Edward Cullen was supposed to be a sincere person, who cared about the people who he loved, and would do anything to protect them. In the movie, he came off as a psychotic stalker. Many scenes involving him were awkward to watch, and he wasn\\'t even to blame. The script was poorly written, and most of his lines were clich√©s. Bella, the female protagonist, was equally awkward. Her character was naturally supposed to be a clumsy, awkward girl, who was selfless, and understanding of others, but Kristen Stewart\\'s performance of Bella was sometimes painful to watch. She had no emotion, and even when she shouted, her facial expression didn\\'t change. She was monotonous and boring. The Cullen family was Edwards\\'s family, consisting of the man who turned him into a vampire, his \"father\" and his \"brothers and sisters\" who were also turned by his father. His brothers Emmett and Jasper, and his sisters, Alice and Rosalie, and even his father Carlisle, were all extras. They had five lines or less, and the story could have continued if they were all erased from the picture. The plot was like a gigantic puzzle. It made no sense unless you had previously read the books and knew what was going to happen anyway. The director skipped scenes vital to the stories plot. The whole chunk of the story where Bella is supposed to fall in love with Edward was skipped. It went from Bella learning that Edward was a vampire, to Bella\\'s becoming frantic at the thought of losing him. It just made no sense, the script was so confusing and there were incomplete thoughts and sentences pulled out of no where. Many people thought that the movie would be aimed at a younger audience, as the books are aimed for, but the movie wasn\\'t aimed at anybody unless they enjoy boring movies with too few comedic moments and vary bad acting. It was a shoddy performance, and if not for the few funny scenes, and the far too far apart action scenes, the entire movie would be a flop. I blame the director.',\n",

Yes, every Who down in Whoville likes Christmas a lot, but the Grinch (Jim Carrey), who lived just north of Whoville did not. The Grinch hated Christmas, the whole Christmas season.It could be because his head wasn\\'t screwed on just right or it could be, perhaps, that his shoes were too tight. But I think the most likely reason of all is that maybe have been that his heart was two sizes to small. Cindy Lou Who (Taylor Momsen) goes and sees who raised the Grinch who talk about the Grinch and say he wasn\\'t a bad Who, he was just different. Cindy gets told the day at school just before the Grinch was last seen again.Jim Carrey is a hit as the Grinch and even in the serious times in this movie he is hilarious. Carrey I last saw in the movie \"Yes Man\" with Zooey Deschanel which was a movie about a guy who always says no and goes to a seminar about saying yes which changes his life and gives him more possibilities in life than he thought he knew. Momsen is much older now and it\\'s fun to see where the actors or actresses end when you saw them when they were younger.

This movie by no means feels or flows like a Coen brothers\\' movie. The story and plot were lame and one could anticipate the next scene from miles away. From the start to the end, the movie couldn\\'t captivate the attention of the audience the way \"No Country\" did in the first few minutes and several other of Coen brothers movies that normally do. Almost everyone over-acted, including the very talented Jeff Bridges. I am not as disappointed in the movie as I am embarrassed for the actors and the Coen brothers who picked out a bad script and ruined their track record on a remake. Matt Damon had little role to play and Josh Brolin, one of the most talented actors, had almost negligible part to play. Ironic that his screen name (Chaney) took more space than his actual appearance. The movie\\'s anchor was this 14 year old girl played by Hailee Steinfeld and it seems the movie was financed by Steinfeld\\'s dad or boyfriend to please her with the biggest part in the movie. This is a low grade production and too sad that Coen brothers will have to live with this low end, high budget failure for the rest of their Hollywood career.',\n",

I have to start by saying that this is not a movie for everyone. I really liked it but it is very slow moving and for the casual movie watcher it may seem like nothing happened. That statement may seem strange but after you watch it it will make sense to you. This is a movie that each scene builds on the next (like most Scorses\\'s) and is hard to talk about without giving anything away but I will say that it is a movie that entertained me all the way through.

Well not truly sorry; just a tad peeved at this flick and how horribly it went astray.It is true, however, that the grim Hayden Christiansen of the new STAR WARS fame is the main character (David Rice), and he has some unique abilities: he can jump through space/time at will, breakfasting on top of the Sphinx in Egypt, jumping back to his New York flat for luncheon pizza, then heading out to surf in Hawaii that same day ...or even hour if he wished it. He learns he has this power during his high school years (the young David is played by Max Thieriot \\x96 see THE ASTRONAUT FARMER) and nearly dies after falling through some thin river ice. He miraculously reappears in a local library, water and all, soaking book stacks. David was trying to retrieve a gift from the ice that he\\'d gotten for a girl he liked named Millie (Rachel Bilson), but he quickly learns that his jumping abilities make him something of a freak, and believes Millie would see him that way too. So he runs away and into the world.Once out amongst the populace he learns how to steal, including jumping into bank vaults and taking as much money as he will. But this also gains him notice by a secret society of men known as Paladins (look up Palatine and you\\'ll find interesting parallels).

And that\\'s about it...The biggest flaw with the film is that there\\'s no set-up to it. We don\\'t really know why Jumpers can do what they do (Genetic/X-Men-like mutation? Alien DNA? Gods?). We also don\\'t know who funds the Paladins with all of their travel, gadgets, and many, many members. I can guess that it might have been the Roman Catholic Church, but it\\'s never even hinted at. If it was the church, then how did Roland get access to secret information, including bank vaults, police records, etc.? With all of its story flaws, Jumpers does have some amazing CGI. Particularly, there was one scene where Roland is in the desert and a Jumper brings a double-decker London bus with him through a jump scar and tries to roll it on top of Roland. That was incredible and made my jaw drop.But that was it. All style over any substance, Jumper was so weak along story lines that I didn\\'t much care what happened to anyone in the film.

(I told you, you shouldn\\'t be reading if you haven\\'t seen/read it already.) It was definitely as sad as it should\\'ve been, but it wasn\\'t nearly as abrupt as it was in the book. It\\'s shocking because of its suddenness. It becomes more real that way; it shocks the reader as much as it does Harry. It just didn\\'t seem jarring enough. Also, the young wizards were casting nonverbally, which will (presumably) create confusion when Harry duels Snape in Half-Blood Prince. Oh, and the Priori Incantatum thing with Voldemort and Dumbledore? What?I will say that Umbridge and Bellatrix Lestrange were perfect for their roles, and the thestrals were very cool. The acting was all extremely well done, the content just left a lot to be desired.But what do I know? It\\'s hard to write movies. I just wish the film has included more of the important, meaningful content.',\n",

I\\'m speechless i saw this 3 times at the cinema and never got sick of it the characters are so well connected and the emotion between them lives on even after the movie finishes. people say its like \"Chronicles of Narnia\" but i say its not yeah it has 3d but thats not the point of the film the Visual effects is only like used to show what the characters are seeing in there minds. As a Rising filmmaker i am amazed at how well casted this movie was and how well the actors done there role mainly by Annasophia Robb and Josh Hutcherson. The original film seemed a bit dull to me it had no real energy the actors were poorly chosen but this one definitely will live on in my heart forever and ever see this film and don\\'t trust the trailers its much better than you think.P.S Keep your mind wide open!',\n",

The plot is so intense this is the few movies where my back was not sore because I was feeling like I was standing up. It is that intense. It really had a cool concept of the future, lots of cool little gadgets here and there. And finaly a movie with a happy ending, I got tired of so many movies having twists and turns then it turned out to be a horrible sad ending, but not this movie. It was perfect. And the movie had great special effects every thing seemed real. This movie was original and just plain fun for anyone, trust me you will come out of the theatre smilling wanting to go see it once more. I recomend it to any one.

The ending left me asking many questions. This may have been the intent but it really did not work for me. The cover-up scheme was so flawed that any detective would have easily noted the clues.

From the Brachiosaurus taking a bite out of the trees, to the T-Rex\\'s pupil dilating when it is shined on by a light, and Tim and Lex being hunted by Raptors in the kitchen. Never before has anyone seen a film this thrilling and terrifying, yet beautiful and majestic. Spielberg did a wonderful job directing this film and really keeps you on the edge of your seat.This movie is very original and the special and sound effects are amazing, especially for 1993. The Raptor and T-Rex\\'s roar gave me chills when I first heard them. The acting is also terrific, Ian Malcolm is my favorite despite his negativity and cynical views, Jeff Goldblum does a great job playing his character. I also liked that this movie was not just about people eating getting eaten by dinosaurs. The main theme was more about how humans should not interfere with nature and cannot control it as said by Dr. Malcolm, \"Life uh...finds a way\". The dinosaurs themselves are not actually in the movie for that long but I think that is better because it makes the scenes they are in more suspenseful along with Spielberg\\'s unique camera shots. John William\\'s music is also great, I will forever remember the main theme song.Overall, this movie is a must see for everyone of all ages.

I believe people have already said a lot about what I had to say. Some breath taking scenes, perfect depiction of the principles of the great man on the celluloid, and a great performance from the cast n crew of the film. And each time, I seem to find something which I somehow seemed to miss in my earlier viewing. Amazing!Now, let me answer some of the comments some people have made.1. Gandhi never hated anyone, not even the Britishers. Remember he wanted to say \"goodbye\" to them \"as friends\" whenever they would leave, and not to take advantage of their WWII predicament. He admired the fairness in their judgment, except that he wanted to bring some changes in their law (as he says during his struggle in South Africa). 2. Gandhi an arrogant man: You should be a kinder-garden kid or you need strong doses of history :) Gandhi was quite the opposite. 3. He was not an opportunist. He was quite the opposite. He did not aspire for any political power, neither his kids benefit from him/his stature. Today, we don\\'t even know where his descendants are. We all know where the Nehrus are (the current Gandhis, as you know, is a misnomer). 4. India being a land of violence: That\\'s what he was fighting against. 5. Indians migrating to nations founded on British rule (i.e. US, UK, Canada, NZ, and Australia): That\\'s not this movie about. Nevertheless, here\\'s the answer. Migration is part of mankind, otherwise those counties listed above would never have been yours. At least, Indians did not conquer any countries, massacre the natives and take over their lands :) 6. This movie is feel good n boring movie: Yes, its almost impossible to find flaws in the great character. Boring? Well, you have not exactly graduated from James Bond movies to movies such as this.',\n",

              " '\"John Wick\" has a lot in common with \"The Equalizer\" (2013). Both feature a former highly skilled assassin who has retired to live in quiet solitude but who is compelled to use his deadly skills again when a Russian mobster commits a despicable act of violence. Denzel Washington is generally considered the better actor and brings a sense of gravitas to his role. However, Keanu Reeves brings more a sense of melancholy and reluctance to his role, which was sadly lacking in TE. Washington looks bigger, stronger and more physically imposing, but never displays any particular skill at martial arts. The fights in TE are shot in semi-darkness and edited with a lot of quick cuts, so Washington\\'s character never seems truly credible as the tough fighter he is supposed to be. In contrast, the fight scenes in JW are masterfully choreographed. One can not only see, but follow the action. Reeves comes across as a much more credible action hero, skilled with guns, knives and his bare hands. The Russian mobsters are much more menacing, evil and capable in TE than in JW, where they are adequate, but less memorable. These gangsters are three-dimensional characters with flaws, foibles and idiosyncrasies that make them more realistic and even a little likable. They also have conflicting agendas, whereas the gangsters in TE are more narrowly focused and unwavering. JW also has a much better production design. The color palate, costumes and cinematography blow TE away. Neither film is perfect. JW starts off a bit slowly attempting to bolster motivations that don\\'t need bolstering. But once it begins, maintains a steady action pace. Between the two, JW is much more enjoyable and Reeves is a better action hero than Washington. JW doesn\\'t have quite the panache or complexity of \"Django Unchained,\" \"Rock \\'n\\' Rolla,\" \"Smokin\\' Aces\" or the underrated \"Lucky Number Slevin,\" but it\\'s a solid effort by all involved.',\n",

Don\\'t get me wrong, one of my favorite films is \"Thelma and Louise\", it\\'s just that I could sniff this one out, and knew it would be a real drag to sit through. Anyway, it came on cable recently, I taped it, and watched the whole thing in about 6 sit downs. That was the only way to digest the platter of vomit that was \"The Devil Wears Prada\". Streep sleepwalked through her performance; there was very little about her character that moved me at all. Hathaway\\'s character was not particularly likable, even though we are supposed to adore her and empathize with her heart wrenching decisions, one of which is cheating on her boyfriend with a sleaze bag fashion industry type. In fact, all of the characters are unlikable, even the aw-shucks boyfriend. This is a movie whose message tries to be \"The triumph of personal integrity over superficiality and ethically challenged ambition\". The attempt at conveying this message falls way short, because the movie spends too much time celebrating the superficiality it pretends to condemn. I was at least hoping for a Darth Vaderesque boss in Meryl Streep, but even that aspect of the movie was well off the mark. She was positively not intimidating. If you want to see a boss from hell movie, watch \"Swimming with Sharks\" with Kevin Spacey. That\\'ll help you get over the headache-inducing waste of time that was \"The Devil Wears Prada\".',\n",

I really enjoyed this film. Aronofsky nailed the world of wrestling. It made me recall the days when Saturday morning was filled with Hulk Hogan, Randy Macho Man, Jake the Snake...the Warrior and all those guys. I found that the battles the Ram fought inside the ring and within himself in connection to his sport was much more invigorating to watch rather than his battles to find love with stripper Cassidy and from his estranged daughter Stephanie.The locker room scenes and scenes of Randy's everyday life were well done, but every scene with Cassidy was just predictable, boring and clich√©. The film could be equally powerful and strong if she never was seen on screen and just another part of his life we know he lost and will never reclaim. However, I often think that perhaps this part of the story may have been better if recast; Evan Rachel Wood has yet to win me over.But thank heavens Mickey Rourke is back what I hope is better than ever, ready to reclaim his own stardom...lets just hope it does not mirror that of Randy's.\",\n",

I loved the first Pitch Perfect film, it introduced the audience to the world of acabellas and singing without using any instruments. The characters were different and fun, and the plot never was clich√©. The second film was fun but lacking in a story. Pitch Perfect 3 lacks the plot, humor, and the characters are no longer interesting from what they once used to be. On a positive note, this third installment is supposed to be the final film in the series with the story concluding the characters. The Bellas are done with college and are living among their lives. Beca (Anna Kendrick) loses her job cause she was not cooperative with her music manager. Fat Amy (Rebel Wilson) lives with Beca and host her own street corner shows singing Amy Winehouse mix ups. When every one is not happy with the path they tried working for, they all meet up at a reunion invited by Emily (Hailee Steinfeld). They all decide to partake on a tour for United Service Organization competing against some ruthless bands that hold no rules and use instruments. There was not much of a plot. We learn that Aubrey (Anna Camp) father is in the military and she all of a sudden gets passes to sing in the tour after their own friends invitation did not open them up to singing at the reunion. Then, there is a sub plot of Fat Amy's father shadowing their group overseas played by John Lithgow, who tries to reconnect with her by placing a stuffed animal on her pillow. And another sub plot with Beca getting the attention from a music manager which he is recruiting only her. Then, in the end as every one started off with their miserable jobs. They all fall back to the same position they started with. Besides they got to see and sing with each other for one last time. This film also lacked in humor and it was not as funny as the first film. Most of the jokes are all Rebel Wilson's character trying to say the most wisecrack lines that are annoying than funny. Hailee Steinfeld's character is the one being poked at for stupid responses. Brittany Snow is falling in love with a military guy with lots of awkward encounters. Hana Mae Lee is still the quiet one and a mystery. Alexis Knapp steps out on this one for majority of the film. And Elizabeth Banks and her co commentator are still on the spot light cracking jokes about feminism and sexist humor. Overall, Pitch Perfect 3 is a miss this time around. It was not as funny. It was boring at times. The characters are not as entertaining as they used to be. The plot is just horrible. I rate the film 2.5 out of 5 stars. I would recommend this film as a rental.

And some of the best actors out there: Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen . . . man, I believed. The kick ass fight scenes did not hurt. The thing that is so marvelous about the X-Men is how redemptive it is. Many of us who were ever bullied as a child, all of us who have ever been oppressed and exploited want to rise up; want them to crawl at our feet. But it's not just about revenge fantasies, though the revenge fantasy was a major, major, component of this story. It's surprising subtle story about the line between revenge fantasies and building a just society. There was a whole lot of stuff going on. I'm no X-Men fangirl, but I've read a comic book now and again (at least the ones written by Joss Whedon) (everyone should read every thing ever written by Joss Whedon, btw) and I'm not sure I would have tracked what happened but for that. I work for a politician, and I love him. But man, I bought the venality of these political men. The metaphor of the dam finally breaking . . . wonderful. Cathartic, but also frighteningly Brechtian. The dam has broken, the long leashed waters unloosed, and we all have to live after the flood. Innocent or not. We still have to live in the world created by our ancestors.

              " \"Before I start this review, I must say that I hate action movies. Sorry, correction: I despise action movies. The fight scenes are always dragged out and takes up the majority of the movie. I wasn't initially pleased to be dragged to see this movie, but it wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be. The movie itself was shorter than the average Hollywood blockbuster, at roughly 107 minutes long. The action scenes weren't as long as I'd thought them to be and in fact were very short. I was happy with this but some hardcore action fans may find a problem with this. So why am I only giving this a 5/10? The reason for that is because the acting is very wooden here. Sam Worthington will hardly score an Oscar nomination for his portrayal of Perseus and Liam Neeson's Zeus leaves much to be desired ( although his wife did die before filming this movie, so it must have been hard on him ). The script was also weak here too, with not a lot of characters getting much dialogue. By the way, before I finish up here, I noticed something interesting: I noticed that there was a hint of atheism during some of the scenes in Argos. I don't know was it intended but I thought it actually made the movie a bit more interesting. In conclusion: it's an OK movie to watch for passing time, but not if you want high quality acting.\",\n",

Despite the cons, I loved the movie-- Cons: Needed more time presenting the internal strife and transformation of the main character (in all areas - assassinations, move to the different life, etc.) -- i.e. take notes from Spiderman 2. The breakdown & pre-breakthrough training sessions along with the ultimate 'breakthrough' didn't give me the needed sense of intense struggle as the former conditioning broke away. And ...

I kept seeing him as the real thing, the real Andy Kaufman (which is both weird and extraordinary), and that boosted the film to become really great.Nothing is sure in the world of Andy Kaufman. Had he been a rebellious politician instead of comedian, there would still be people trying to find him alive. The movie portrays this with excellence - it is very hard to keep track of the truth, and in the end, one is left with the number one question: did he fake his own death too, just like he did with the old lady?Believing in the idea that there is NOTHING we can\\'t make fun of, I think Andy Kaufman embodies one of the most important concepts there is on this planet: we must not take ourself so seriously.',\n",

It's not too hard to follow in the early going but when the hero Ashitaki makes his way East to the land of the Forest Spirit he's faced with choices that put him on questionable sides of relationships already formed. While trying to save his own life endangered by a poisonous encounter with the boar demon Nago, his overriding mission is to 'see with eyes unclouded by hate'. For this he must valiantly strive to understand the motivations and prerogatives of those he meets, including monk Jigo, Lady Eboshi of Irontown and the wolf princess San, a human raised by wolves. In turn, each of these individuals comes to understand that good and evil are not mutually exclusive character traits, but exist in all to varying degrees. The way this all plays out can be confusing and is not made easier by the depiction of characters like Moro, the large threatening white wolf who by design one would consider a male, but in actuality is the mother of San. It's an intricately woven tale and loyal fans of anime will find it spellbinding, though I must admit, for myself it took a concerted effort to follow and understand.\",\n",

A couple horrible sayings into the movie (Wettie, shutties, and salty to name a few)I realized the movie was actually a comedy! And instead of being mad, thinking the writer thought teens say this shiz, I laughed realizing it was part of the subtle comedy of the movie.That being said, I had no idea this was written by the writer of Juno (Which I loved!). It also reminded me of Twilight the movie, its feel and use of great music, even the movie's band had some surprisingly great songs. Not to mention Adam Brody, who is the bad ass heart-throb, who fronts the band.So while Megan Fox is a definite stand out, I found the rest of the cast to be some what lacking, namely Needy.

              " 'Though \"The Fighter\" presents itself as another boxing movie, it has much more to offer. The story\\'s focus is Micky Ward (Mark Wahlberg), who dreams of winning a boxing title. The plot includes the relationships with his bartender girlfriend (Amy Adams), his brother Dicky (Christian Bale), his mother (Melissa Leo) and the remaining members of his family. Despite Wahlberg being the lead, the supporting cast steals the show. Both Bale and Leo won Oscars for their performances. Having seen this, both thoroughly deserved them. I\\'ve seen Bale in many movies, dating back to when he was a kid. He has really grown up and engulfed himself into his character, which goes on a path of drug abuse, prison, and later redemption. His character is a jerk to the core, yet he builds sympathy for his character. He\\'s hard not to like; he\\'s funny, charming, and knows how to throw a good punch. Like Bale, Leo adds quite a few layers to her character. Rather than following the one- dimensional villainous mother, she comes off as someone to pity rather than despise. She does what she thinks is right for her son Micky, but she\\'s so blinded by this that she fails to realize what he really wants. \"The Fighter\" could very easily have fallen into the category of a soap opera (and to a degree it is), but it so much better and more believable via such powerful performances. David O. Russel has made a well-done masterpiece. \"The Fighter\" will make you laugh a lot. It will engage and move you. And it may even make some cry. The only regret I have about this film is that I did not see it in theaters. Even so, I am glad that I viewed this film, and I will definitely watch it again in the future.',\n",
              " \"Rudy is one of the most motivational movies I have ever seen. The fact that it is true provides even more of an inspiration to the viewer. The most important scenes in the movie are when Rudy decides to apply to Notre Dame after his best friend dies, when Rudy finally gets accepted to Notre Dame, when Fortune tells Rudy not to quit the team, when the team players tell Dan Devine to let Rudy dress, and, finally, when the crowd chants Rudy's name and he gets to play in the game. Rudy represents a person that everyone can admire. He is a person who never gives up no matter how many people discourage him and tell him that he can't achieve his dreams. This is shown in the scene when Jamie complains to Coach Parseghian that Rudy is too serious about a practice. Parseghian responds to him basically saying that if he had any bit of the heart that Rudy has, then he would have gotten so much further than he is right now. The cinematography in the movie was very focused on the emotions in it, the sound also went along with the different emotions. We see this because there is theme music that is played softly in heart-felt scenes and then more intensely in more motivational scenes. Rudy is a film that will have anyone watching it leave the movie feeling inspired and touched by a person who never gave up on his dream.\",\n",

The film is set five weeks before Christmas and tells several different stories that involve different kinds of love, so there is something for anyone. There is also a great British cast list, including: Hugh Grant as the new Prime Minister who falls in love with Martine McCutcheon's character who has just started working for him; Liam Neeson who, after losing his wife, helps his stepson to win the girl he loves; Colin Firth who, after finding out that his brother is sleeping with his wife, goes to France to write a book and falls in love with his housekeeper but there's a language barrier as she's from Portugal; Emma Thompson who has to stay strong even though her husband, played by Alan Rickman, is having an affair with one of his workers and Bill Nighy, who has just released a Christmas single based on Wet Wet Wet's song 'Love is All Around' replacing the word 'Love' with 'Christmas', and it's about him promoting his single but in the worst way possible. In my opinion, I loved each story, the actors were all brilliant, there were plenty of laughs throughout and I loved the random cameos from the likes of Ant & Dec and Rowan Atkinson. I would definitely recommend this to anyone that's a fan of romantic comedies and doesn't mind a bit of cheesiness.\",\n",

Time was I considered him a viable bridge between the real showwriters - Porter, Kern, Arlen, Loesser, Rodgers etc - and todays' no talent crew, but around the time of Pacific Overtures I begin to grow apart from his growing obsession with pushing the barriers of the musical to breaking point. Whilst he never really was a melodist - even his one bona fide 'hit' Send In The Clowns could hardly be described as a soaring melody - he did used to be able to make a half decent fist of a melody, alas, those days have long gone. The tone is set from the start via the muted, sombre colouring - this is a Musical, man, not a wake. Think of those primary colors that used to fill the frame; okay, we no longer have three-strip Technicolor but we can, surely, offer just a touch of brightness to offset the plodding score.

Does a movie always have to be very deep with crazy highfalutin dialogue for the damn critics to consider it a good one? Well that's just plain crazy. This a really good, fun movie with great music that we can easily understand and sing to. Sorry critics, musicals does not always have to be an opera. Also, it is perfect for our times because of the divide and bigotry that's going on now. This movie has a moving lesson about that. Oh and the best part, it makes fun of high-brow critics.

I saw this movie in the movies back when it came out, and found myself laughing hysterically. I wasn\\'t laughing because the movie was sweet, but because Richard Curtis has served up a ridiculous parody of these types of movies. The funny thing is that nobody gets it. Every story, however, parodies the idea of love as something that is superficial and based on looks, rather than something that is deep and lasting. There is not a single moment in any of the multiple story lines that offers a sentimental reason for characters to be together. In particular, I thought 1) the storyline where the British guy goes to America and the American women immediately fall all over themselves for him and 2) the storyline where the Prime Minister\\'s girlfriend is called \"fat\" and \"plump\" over and over again by everyone that knows her were not meant to be taken literally.

This was slightly off-putting for me in the beginning but as the film progressed I realised that Woody Allen has reached the point where he can produce any kind of masterpiece even if that means unbalancing the notion of what has been perceived and eagerly acclaimed as his \"style\". The dialogue is excellent for once more, the plot ingeniously conceived and developed. The theme of crime and punishment along with that of luck and its relation to life are both persistent throughout the film. A lot of wisdom and a lot of opera that helps build the tension.

Terrible villain again, didn't remember his name 20min after the movie ended, did pretty much nothing but showed some amazing prophet skills 2.So many stupid things like how did villain know iron man will come at the very end, how did he know nobody told iron man how his parents died, also the big fight at the airport was just too dumb, pretty much all mighty jean nm.2 and vision in the same fight where black widow and hawk eye should just really be hoping, praying and dodging some random explosions... this list could really go on and on 3.SO OVERCROWDED. Why the hell did ant-man join the fight? What is his motivation? How does random Nigerian prince have powers to fight CA and bucky ? HOW ??? Nobody but CA, Iron man and bucky had story behind them (pretty pathetic though),others were just useless guys fighting. At least they didn't ruin Hulk even more :-) 4.Really ? Tony tried to kill his friend CA and bucky and then after being defeated he is f***ing cool with it? Best buddies again? 5.In iron man 3 tony was able to call 30 auto iron mans to fight for him, here he got challenged by a freaking falcon with his wings? Also at the airport he was unable to defeat CA and at the very end he almost rekt two of them ? ... Guess I'm back to stupid stuff... On the other side, good things: 1.Spider-man - yea this kid with no story in movie at all was one of few good funny things about this movie 2.Cool fights right ?

I will agree that planet terror is the better of the two. Death proof is a slow moving movie but pays off huge at the end. It actually gets better the more times you watch it. Planet terror has all the action and gore. It flows really quick and has great pacing. This film is a must. See them individually, then when they release it as one see it how it was meant to be.

This film begins with a nearly suffocating claustrophobic atmosphere, one in which the outside world can't possibly exist and there's only the starkly lit mildewy wooden paneled interior of an old family morgue. The mystery mounts and the two leads examine an inexplicable body, one in which they can't find a cause of death. The body is untouched and yet her insides show unbelievable trauma.The mounting atmosphere and tension of the first half is unfortunately mishandled in the second half. The film becomes a rather bare-bones spooky jump scare exercise that leads to a shocking revelation that really does deliver (it's genuinely intriguing and so much more could have been done with it) on the first half's tension. There's no follow through.There are great ideas here but a lack of focus in the middle, or maybe a fear that if jumps in the night didn't start happening soon the audience would get bored.

Product placement gone wrong, so very wrong.The direction seemed off, too. Edward Norton is the bad guy, and it was so obvious right from the start.

              " \"Mean-spirited indeed(ski) would be he who criticises a movie for its timing. But then again, I am. So here goes: Spielberg did everything and more in Terminal's 2-hour plus running time in 'Amazing Stories', the 80s / 90s feel-good TV shows that managed the same yearnings for innocence and the American Dream -- but in 40 minutes or less.A lot earlier than that, and almost certainly before the majority of reviewers here were even born, Frank Capra did the same. But with a stronger script. And a better cast. And -- and this is the clincher -- a far greater sense of timing.For 'Terminal' is at least 60 years too late. The feel-good to which it aspires, the whimsy which it (laudably) seeks to celebrate, has long gone from any scenario involving the uncomprehending stateless trapped in the aspic of a hostile world.Truth is, it's difficult to think when such a scenario was remotely heart-warming anyway. Unless I missed some great hit-of-the-season show like 'Ellis Island: The Laugh-In'.With sets, art direction and special effects to emigrate, if not die, for, 'Terminal' certainly has a heightened sense of reality. But other than that, it's stupefyingly empty, a vast and expensive transit lounge of half-formed ideas ground under the footsteps of a script that moves so clinically from A to B that it seems no more than a mechanistic reprise of elementary screen-writing -- you know the primer I mean, where 10 pages in this happens and 20 pages in this happens, and the hook gets baited not a moment later than halfway down page 38. . .With 'Close Encounters' and 'ET', Spielberg showed true genius as a film maker capable of chronicling humanity's endearing panoply of hopes, dreams, fallibilities and fears.With 'Terminal', he has Tom Hanks doing a Chaplinesque shuffle.There's no humanity here. No relevance (as Capra had). And seemingly no understanding of the real obscenity of small lives shattered by big bureaucracies. Everyman does not live in this particular terminal, only a cast of characters unearthed from Capra's back-stock, all of them increasingly over-drawn and thus increasingly over-wrought.Calling this 'a masterpiece' is like calling a painting-by-numbers canvas a genuine artwork.Come on, Spielberg. The creative genius you have as one of the finest film-makers of this or any other generation cries out for something far, far better than this. Do us all a favour and find it quickly, before people start to wonder if your talent has left the departure gate once and for all. . .\",\n",
              " \"Back Swan is not a movie for the kids & for those who want simple action & adventure. It is not even as scary as the trailers of it. Black Swan has the trappings of the beauty of ballet as a frame work for a dark story of complex proportions. It is not for the kids either as it is a very mature themed movie.There is no doubt this is Natalie Portman's film. The entire focus of the film is on Nina Sayers. She is replacing Beth Macintyre (Winona Ryder) as the star of Swan Lake in A new production by Thomas LeRoy (Vincent Cassel). Beth is the person who has been the great star but is now gone. Nina is the new choice to replace her. Beth is obviously very unhappy.Beth accuses Nina of giving Thomas special favors to win the role. While this is not the case as the audience is well aware, Beth's accusations turn out to be more of a warning to the darkness she is heading into. Nina's emotions towards Beth are played out through the first 2/3rds of the film. About 1/3 of the way into the movie Lily (Mila Kunis) shows up & gets immediate attention as Nina's rival & then a part of her fantasy as well.Veteran actress Barbara Hershey plays Nina's mom(Erica), whose main role is helping Nina & trying to keep her reined in so she does not get into trouble. For half the film, she is able to do this. As Nina passes into her own very personal madness, she breaks away from her mom. Between Lily, & Thomas LeRoy, plus Nina's warped reality, the film builds up to the only possible climax at Nina's performance of a lifetime.This is powerful drama and while Portman looks a little too thin at times, her acting is right on. The supporting players are there but only for their interaction with Nina. The film is very focused which is it's strength. The eye candy of Portman (almost 30) and Kunis (28) reminds me that it is great that these actresses in their prime get a film in which women pretty much dominate the screen.\",\n",
              " 'Even though \"Warcraft\" can by now surely be regarded as a part of cultural heritage, and warrants a film to its name, I expected that its cinematic incarnation be nothing but a cynical exploitation of the popularity of the game itself. Not really knowing that much about the game I could appreciate the film purely as a film.Gosh, what a pleasant surprise! The production, the direction and the script must really breathe some fresh air into already stale \"sword and sorcery\" genre. Principal shooting reportedly took four months and post-production took additional twenty. And you can see that the time was well spent. The CGI characters look incredibly vigorous and real, the scenery as well, thanks to motion capture, skilled animators and acres and acres of render-farms. The cinematography (or whatever filters they\\'ve used in the post) is vividly colorful, luscious and glamorous as one should expect from a fantasy film. The costume design, the props and the sets are done impeccably and to a tremendous detail.The script is unexpectedly self-conscious. Although it pits humans into battle against yet another monster species, we\\'re allowed to observe both sides on equal footing. Both factions have their motives, their good and bad guys - we learn what\\'s at stake for all of them. Not only it makes harder for the audience to pick sides, it makes for a more thrilling viewing as well.Still, despite all these things going for \"Warcraft\", it\\'s still the direction that sits at the heart of it all. It plays to the strength of the script, it\\'s concise and matter-of-fact, and it never leaves a dull moment. Timing is so good that it makes you both laugh at tremble at desired moments. You can freely see it in 2D and give your eyes a break, no thrills will be lost. Really kudos to always intriguing Duncan Jones. Who knew \"Zowie Bowie\" would get so far. I hope he sticks around for the sequels.If I should name flaws and thus justify not giving \"Warcraft\" the highest mark, I\\'d say that the pace, although needed to keep the attention in the complex story, didn\\'t leave much room for relationships between characters to sink in completely. If it did, it would be an Oscar-worthy material, but hey. Doesn\\'t matter all that much.There will be people who will complain that the story is derivative. And indeed, how many stories about humans, kings, good and evil wizards, monsters and dwarfs are already there? Quite a lot, no doubt. It doesn\\'t bother me, though. I\\'m glad this one came to be, and that is was brazen enough to go through all the familiar tropes of the genre as if they were anew. Because \"Warcraft\" could give lessons to some better known franchises of this and other genres. It could, for one, teach \"Lord of the Rings\" how to not be cold and heartless and it could teach Marvel how to avoid making listless villains and stories without stakes.I\\'ll never ever play \"Warcraft\" the game, but I\\'m now thankful for its existence because it gave me another cinematic franchise to look forward to in the future.',\n",

Underdeveloped characters, underdeveloped relationships, gaping plot holes, and a movie in a bad need of a good rewrite, plague DC Comics first cinematic foray outside the Batman-Superman franchises, making Green Lantern possibly the last DC movie other than Batman or Superman we will see for a while.The Green Lanterns are intergalactic police officers, and Earthling Hal Jordan just so happens to be the first human chosen to join their ranks, but alas an evil is brewing in the farthest reaches of space, and Hal must learn how to master his newfound powers, or else... You probably know what will happen next.Green Lantern wants to adhere to the superhero movie formula, but it does so with little charm, little wit, and not a lot in terms of flow from one scene to the other. Not to mention, characters come and go with no sense of where they came from or where they went when not on screen. Should we care about Peter Sarsgaard\\'s villain, Hector Hammond? His character is not even introduced till the second act and by then it is like, \"Who is this guy, and why should I care when he becomes the psychotic villain?\" Then there is star, Ryan Reynolds, who obviously cared about the source material, giving Hal Jordan his all, but when you\\'re in a movie that simply wants to try and get to the next action set piece as fast as possible so that they can satisfy the seven-year-old who is going to buy the toys, it is hard to have much to toy with (like that pun?).

Stereotypical North American music was played through out the movie, (I believe Sweet Home Alabama emerged some where?) and it didn't add to the film AT ALL.I wouldn't recommend this to anyone, save yourself and don't go see it.\",\n",
              " \"Ang Lee's interpretation of the Hulk remains to be one of the most underrated comic book movies of all time. I've learned to appreciate what Lee was trying to do at the time and rank this film up there with The Dark Knight. To put his career on his line and create something unique is a bold move on Lee's part and I've got to say: Bravo.When I was younger I really only loved the action scenes. Everything else was okay by comparison. But now if I want the Hulk in action, I can at least view Ed Norton's Incredible Hulk.Ang Lee's Hulk is a though-provoking piece of art with it's only fault being that ridiculous dog fight scene. Eric Bana gets lost in the role of Bruce Banner, conflicted with repressed memories from his childhood. Jennifer Connelly turns in an Oscar-worthy performance as Betty Ross, trying to justify everything that's happening to a man that she still loves despite their relationship problems. Sam Elliot plays the conflicted father, who at first appears to be a by-the-book general, but by the end really puts himself in any father's shoes. Josh Lucas is the corrupt corporate sleaze bag, trying to own a piece of the world in the palm of his hand. And lastly, Nick Nolte, who plays the edgy scientist who's curiosity with science transforms into a dangerous obsession.At the core of it, the film is really about father-issues. It's a psychological drama, and a damn good one. Lee masterfully blended reality with comic book fiction through the use of his editor, who was able to give the film it's comic book feel, literally, without making it redundant. Lee's editor should have also gotten an Oscar-nod.The pace is beautifully slow at times, trying to find what shakes Bruce Banner at his core. But whenever the action kicks in, it leaves you wanting more.Danny Elfman's composes a unique and haunting soundtrack that really pushes his boundaries and almost makes you forget that it's a Danny Elfman score. Within the first couple of seconds of the opening titles you know you're in for a dark and twisted ride down Bruce Banner's mind.With Marvel's recent films they're really only using each individual superhero movie to build up to the Avengers. And while that's okay, it really doesn't leave a lot of room for each character to grow. This film, along with all the other superhero films that came out around this time, accomplishes that. Well except for Ghost Rider and the Fantastic Four...To sum it up, after seven years I feel like this movie should be given a second chance. Ang Lee has never disappointed.8/10 (NOW YOU MAY ALL DISAGREE WITH ME, because I know that's what you guys do.)\",\n",
              " 'Alright, this movie is pretty horrible. It\\'s horrible in so many aspects, which is honestly all of them, to the point where it\\'s actually pretty entertaining.You can just sit there and laugh, goof after goof after goof, it never gets boring. Okay,let me explain how horrible it is.-Cinematography: This movie is ripe with something I like to refer to as forehead shots. There are a lot of scenes in this movie that feature a close up of a character\\'s face. But it isn\\'t a normal close up, rather, 40% of the screen, the distance between the top of a character\\'s head and the top of the screen, will be nothing but empty space, meaning that your eyes will naturally center on a person\\'s shiny polished forehead. Aside from forehead shots, we\\'ve got scenes that are filmed in different times of the day and in different places, not natural day to night/place to place transition within the story, but different places for one scene! Imagine this: Main character meets bad guy. Camera switches to bad guy. Daylight. Camera switches to hero. Nighttime and different interior. Overall video quality is poor, as in, old VHS tape poor.The video quality, for a movie that came out in 1991, is sub par. -Audio: The music sounds like something from the Sega Genesis. Music aside, 50% of the entire audio of the movie, is dubbed in a studio. I kid you not.Two guys are going in a car, there is about a 50 meter distance between the camera man and the actors, and when they talk, the audio is perfectly clear. There\\'s also a scene where 3 people have the same identical voice, saying the same identical lines.\"HEY WAIT UP I WANNA TALK YOU!\". Just an example.-Acting: The whole movie feels as if it was shot on one take.The performance is so bad, so generic and more often than not over the top, to the point where the whole movie, turns into one big blooper. The main character, Samurai cop ( who, although the movie states he is fluent in Japanese, he can\\'t pronounce the most basic of Japanese names even if his life depended on it), you just can\\'t relate to him; he is a hulking mass of polished muscles, that is immune to bullets, who has no character development. In fact, all people have no character development. They are the same throughout the movie. There are plenty gun fights in the movie, and whenever somebody dies, the death scenes are really, really exaggerated, and if you pause and look at the \"wounds\" ,there are no bullet wounds, no ripped cloth or anything, it\\'s just ketchup. The two main characters, Samurai Cop and his buddy, look a lot like the duo from Lethal Weapon, and I mean a lot. -Story: Well, the story is about two detectives investigating a Japanese crime gang, who for some reason, have only one Japanese member, and that\\'s the main boss. Well, they don\\'t do much investigating. In fact, half of the movie is just filler. As in super long needless sex scene filler. ( For some strange reason, the sex scenes are the ONLY part of the movie where the cinematography is okay.). The plot is so simple, linear, and underdeveloped, to the point where there is no plot at all. The film makers knew it, it\\'ll become obvious within the final 20 minutes of the movie; it\\'s like the director said \" You know what? We\\'ve got nothing, might as well make them go on a rampage and kill everybody. Because that\\'s what normal people do\". -Other things to consider: It\\'s offensive to women. The vast majority of female characters, and I mean literally the vast majority, are portrayed as sex objects, nothing more.The poster for the movie, at least the original one, bears heavy similarity to a previous movie poster called Maniac Cop. It\\'s also worth nothing that the two movies shares the same main actor, Robert Z\\'Dar. I\\'ve come to believe that Samurai Cop tried to leech of the popularity of Maniac Cop, which came 3 years earlier. And that\\'s pretty much it. It\\'s horrible, but it\\'s so horrible, you can laugh at it.',\n",
              " 'Something a friend of mine talked with me about after he and I had seen the film was a good point about the film\\'s dramatic structure (which prompted me to see the film a second time, aside from knowing intrinsically it would get doused in Oscar liquid). It\\'s like a darker, slightly harsher Aesop tale, with simplicity in its message ingrained into it, but with power none-the-less. I wouldn\\'t say even after a second viewing that Million Dollar Baby, Clint Eastwood\\'s latest film as one of the few remaining Hollywood auteurs, is one of his very best films (I don\\'t know if I may be one of only a few that found Mystic River more shattering on the whole). Still, I think that at the least with these two latest films, Eastwood has reached on his own level the heights of one of his great dramatic influences- director Vittorio De Sica. His films were filled with an intuitive touch of humanity, observing where heart lies within people, and where it doesn\\'t. Aside from the darker themes that the film brings up, it\\'s also at the core a simple tale of those who observe who has heart, kindness, and who doesn\\'t.Eastwood is better than usual as Frankie, a trainer and owner of a boxing gym. His friend and observer of the film\\'s details, Scrap (Morgan Freeman, supreme in his understated performance), was once a boxer too, but with going too far with a fight, he became half-blind, but given a job and residence by a guilt-ridden Frankie (who is so for that and a few other things, some kept perfectly ambiguous). When he loses his boxer for being \\'over-protective\\', a woman, Maggie (Hilary Swank, intuitive as always in her scenes), asks to be trained. After much convincing, Frankie takes her on, and little by little, he gets looser on his strict terms of not being questioned with his teachings. Then, as Maggie finally reaches the top, there comes what is called in screen writing as the second turning point, and the story turns its last act into the contemplative, the deep, and the tragic.One thing that grabbed me even more so on a second viewing was that the theme of what boxing does to the human spirit and psyche is a double-edged sword. On the one hand, as Scrap observes, it\\'s \"un-natural\", to be moving around getting right in the face of pain and not running away, and how it is not a very glamorous \\'sport\\' at all (a theme that makes it more worthy than a lessor boxing movie would give). On the other hand, it also goes in hand with the theme of having heart; the two supporting characters of Danger (in a satisfactory performance by Baruchel) and Shawrelle (Mackie), who are a major contrast. I really liked how Eastwood and writer Paul Haggis (from a book of short stories) dealt with the sub-plot to go so well with the main plot of Frankie, Scrap and Maggie. Another exceptional scene that makes this point clearer- and more resonant as the final act unfolds- is when Maggie gets a treat on her 33rd birthday from Scrap, and he tells his story about how he lost sight in his eye. In this scene, both of the actors are brilliant in their tone and reactions, it makes for one of the more meaningful, and dramatically compelling, pieces of the story.I wouldn\\'t say, as I said, that the film is entirely flawless (which is arguable, I know). One problem I had both times I saw it, though not overall, was with Morgan Freeman\\'s narration. For the most part it is insightful and narratively correct, but unlike Freeman\\'s key narration role (as the key observer in Shawshank Redemption), not every line seemed very crucial for the story. It is a simple story with simpler, sometimes philosophical notes of narration, but I sometimes wished that everything had to be outlined - one can sense things right in Eastwood\\'s face and eyes while Freeman talks gruffly behind him. And, arguable still, the sheer simplicity of the film does leave it so that one can\\'t figure out parts of the story for themselves.Never-the-less, the film is an extraordinary stroke of skill for Eastwood as a director. If one can\\'t say that his performance is one of his very best, one could say that his direction, his use of the camera (via DP Tom Stern), is at a peak. The way he uses his strokes of lighting and darkness, and with the way he can control the camera and not be (un-appropriately) flashy, makes it extremely professional. That he\\'s been known to shoot scenes in one or two takes makes for such a sweetly spontaneous result, however totally controlled. Indeed, I agree whole-heartedly with one critic who said \"to call this an old man\\'s film is a sincere compliment\", especially on the craftsman side. A-',\n",
              " 'I have seen quite many WW2 films in the past, yet very few of them managed to amaze and shock me as \"Der Untergang\" did. Under Oliver Hirschbiegel\\'s excellent direction, we watch the agonizing last hours inside Hitler\\'s bunker, as accounted for by his young secretary Traudl Junge (Alexandra Maria Lara). We watch Hitler (Bruno Ganz), in his peak of his insanity, as he awaits for imaginary troops to save him and his motherland, while his closest associates start to realize that the game is over and begin to desert him en masse. We watch Eva Brown (Juliane Kohler), who amidst the turmoil and destruction, her main preoccupation is to die looking beautiful, so she chooses the poison instead of the bullet. We watch Frau Goebells (Corinna Harfouch) who prefers to have her children killed than live in a world of \"decadants\". All in all, we watch the members of the Nazi elite and their entourage spending their last moments awaiting their well-deserved fate, with their reactions varying from binge drinking to committing suicide.Bruno Ganz delivers an amazing performance definitely worthy of an Oscar. He is amazing as Hitler, switching from manic and hysterical to sweet and caring, in an a paranoid way. The other members of the cast are also doing a great job, portraying the personalities of that time in a highly realistic way. The fact that the dialogs are in German adds to the astonishing realism of the film even more, making it look like a professional documentary.Some people accused the film for displaying Hitler in a more \"humane\" manner than appropriate. I definitely disagree with the accusation: Hitler is not displayed as humane; he is simply portrayed exactly as he was, namely a paranoid and ruthless fanatic, yet who had also some moments in which he displayed compassion and fondness. The whole point is to see this monstrous personality exactly as he was, and not try to conceal some aspects of his character in the name of political correctness; Hirschbiegel deserves credit for achieving this difficult goal immaculately.\"Der Untergang\" is a 10/10 film which everyone should watch.',\n",
              " \"I went into the theatre with mixed expectations... Thinking of Ryan Reynolds in a serious character position (Blade: Trinity doesn't count here) sounded dangerous, but interesting, and I wasn't disappointed. He plays George Lutz, an easy-going guy with a great lifestyle. Recently married, he lives with his new wife Kathy (Mellisa George) who most Aussies will recognise from the long-running series 'Home and Away.' Reynolds doesn't let us down in one of his best performances, considering before this his history contained comedy all around. The movie starts off in good fashion also. Instead of a long, boring start sequence, the action kicks off around 10 minutes in, and i'm sure a lot of people will appreciate this.The main storyline revolves around the Lutz family, including Kathy's children Billy, Michael and Chelsea, who have recently moved into a deceivingly beautiful Victorian house inside a gorgeous forest-like surrounds of Amityville, and their 28 day stay before fleeing the house in terror, never to return again, even for their possessions. The movie tells as much as possible on what the Lutz family encountered in those 28 days, and all I can say is this... a terrifying sequence of events which in turn, turned out to be a true story. If you're like me and enjoy a faster-than-average storyline with fast thrills and action, this is the movie for you...But I warn you, the jumpy fright scenes aren't seen coming, so be careful!!! 8/10\",\n",

              " 'I have to write about this movie because I read so many comments on Hanna being a\\xa0monster. Nobody is a monster in this movie. The message of the movie is: We are all neither good nor evil, we are always a mixture of both. The world is not a black and white place, it\\'s not even gray - it\\'s multicolored. And if anyone sees Michael only as an innocent victim, what about not telling anyone about Hanna\\'s secret? His statement could have saved her life. Both protagonists \\x96 though in a totally different way - suffer from the same very human character flaw: They both have a secret they want to hide by all costs because they are ashamed of it. In order to hide this shame they both do things that are wrong. Their actions are somehow always human and understandable. (Whoever thinks he\\'s above it suffers from an illusion.) They both eventually get eaten up by guilt and their lives take the course of their consequences. This movie is a dark and ambiguous story that upsets our values of morality showing victims as possible culprits and culprits as possible victims. The question of guilt is not being easily answered here. This movie won\\'t help you understanding life better but it will make you think about life and maybe your personal guilt.On one side there is the law - our justice. But there is a second justice system within each of us: We judge and punish ourselves more appropriate than any court of law could ever do. Sometimes our own morality is even more radical and cruel than the one of the \"law\". When we judge ourselves, we often get \"life\" or even a death sentence - with no possibility of parole.Even though I read the book and knew the story I was deeply moved by this movie. I did not give it a ten only because in my opinion the movie only partially succeeded in showing the devastating impact that Michael\\'s first love experience had on all his upcoming relations.',\n",

              " 'I really enjoyed this alien-invasion movie. Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt are both truly fantastic. The enemy is suitably terrifying. The story (each day relived over and over again) is quite interesting and well done, although of course not at all original. It\\'s the kind of movie where you don\\'t want to leave your seat because you might miss something.I\\'d give the move about an 8.5, but I\\'m going to round it down for the reasons explained below. Also, the movie didn\\'t actually move me (except a bit at the very end). Another problem was that the shooting of the fast-moving spider thingies was getting a little tedious. An obvious sop for the video-game generation.I would definitely see this one if I were you! I saw it in 2-D, and it was fine. No need to pay extra.OK, script writers, listen up! There is a difference between recruit units and regular military units. Please stop writing dialogue and scenarios for regular military units that make them look like they are still in recruit training. For example, an NCO wouldn\\'t and probably couldn\\'t order regular soldiers (especially elite soldiers) to eat playing cards. They would think he had gone bonkers. Maybe in the Russian infantry...Another example: an overweight guy might appear in recruit training, but not afterwards and certainly not in an elite unit. There are very few overweight people in the kind of unit depicted in this movie. How would an overweight guy have been able to manhandle the exoskeletal suit and the rigorous combat training shown in this movie?I know ragtag soldiers are entertaining, but the real military (certainly in the US) doesn\\'t tolerate it. Please stop making it look in movie after movie like military units are routinely filled with wisecracking, independent mavericks. Some odd behavior is tolerated in elite units, but this is based on a bedrock of professionalism. It\\'s not ragtag.NCOs do not routinely refer to privates as \"maggots\". These are people the NCOs lead and work with every day. Why would they demean them in this way? This clich√© misrepresents the nature of an NCO\\'s leadership over private soldiers. A word like this might be used at a certain stage in basic training, but even then the word would be used carefully and only in the right context. It works partly because the training NCO doesn\\'t see the private again after the recruit training is finished.In the military, it would be unusual, unprofessional, pointless and borderline abusive for an NCO to seriously address a complete stranger (even a lowly private convicted of desertion) as \"maggot\". Apart from that, surely as a professional writer you can see that \"maggot\" is hopelessly clich√©.On the eve of a major d-day, an NCO would not reprimand soldiers for mere gambling, especially elite soldiers. It wouldn\\'t happen because tension and stress relief would be a major issue at that point. Nor would they do PT. The risk of injury would be too great. There would be equipment checks, forced rest, final briefings, special meetings, religious services, and so on.In the military, a deserter is not simply dumped into another military unit, especially an elite unit about to go into a d-day situation. No, a deserter goes to prison or gets some other suitable punishment. There is a difference between prison and the military. (Hard to see the difference from your mansion in Hollywood, I know.) If you were going to have an airborne assault like the one depicted in this movie, the DZ wouldn\\'t be at the beach. No, that would make no sense.',\n",
              " \"Robin Williams is a so-so actor. He's been in great movies like Aladdin and Jumanji, but also bad ones such as Man of the Year.

I wasn't that big a fan of Julia Roberts, but I can't think of anyone who would've been better.As for the movie itself, it's really long for a kid's movie, and the whole Tinkerbell love affair was rather disturbing. (Also, did nobody else freak out when Peter went from being in love with Wendy to being in love with her daughter?) It's imaginative and fun though, and that's what's important.

(ex star wars, lotr, matrix?).2)Based on legendary characters and their adventures, these are somewhat more difficult but can always work by changing the plot every time (ex Indiana Jones,die hard,rush hour, ANACONDA, load of B movies like TREMORS).3)comic book and video game sequels (self explanatory).4)Exploitation sequels these are the toughest to handle and are as difficult to understand as the title I\\'ve given them.Based on the concept of extracting the maximum from a one off concept the got much bigger than anticipated, the original succeeded on multiple factors (Story, character, plot, concept, big action scene etc) which makes making sequels difficult but still lucrative. (Ex SHREK, potc, SPEED,ice age, JURRASIC PARK (multitype but the 3rd and maybe 4th fit here).This being an exploitation sequel the movie is quite clear.1)ONly some characters were developed in the original so way to much extra billing has been given to people that were once only side jokes (the loads of fairytale people).2)The plot is razor thin and weak and the very base on which the first one was made (spoof of the fairy tales) is now lost.3)The jokes are getting stale (how many ugly ogre, farting and gingerbread jokes can you have?).4)They had enough content for 1 movie they pulled of a very good second one, that kind of confidence is not good.5)Demographics take the front seat, adults, teens, fans, children, blacks, whites, etc etc everyone has been taken into account.Still this movie has its plus points.1)The main characters are still hilarious and you have lots of funny moments especially from Donkey and Puss in boots who are the stars of the film.2)The fatherhood track is really really funny.3)Chilren really seemed to really enjoy this movie although the demographically pleasing content is clearly unsuitable for children.4)The movie is short and sweet and really funny in pieces, if a dozen teasers were made they would all be funny.IT HAS BEEN BROADLY ACCEPTED THAT I HAVE THE MENTAL AGE OF A 12 YR OLD AND ME NOT FINDING THE SPARK IN A MOVIE MADE FOR MY AGE GROUP IS A PROBLEM.The complete package is ordinary at best except if watched with children which pushes it up-to good or even very good.Watch only if your a fan OR in a very good mood and \"SEQUEL PREPARED\".Keep low expectations and you may just meet or exceed them.-s typical exploitation sequel, LACKS THE SPARK, many jokes are stale.+/-s puss in boots and donkey given major billing (i like them).+s funny in pieces (though not as good as a whole), SUPERB GRAPHICS, short and sweet, VERY GOOD FOR CHILDREN.total 5/10 ( just fell below expectations (after factoring in sequel), with children and correct company may even reach a 7).PS ANS TO MY QUESTION HOW MANY GINGERBREAD FARTING ETC JOKES CAN YOU HAVE?

              " \"I caught this movie for free and have to say that I liked it for the first half. The second half sent me into a whirlwind of confusion and anger, mainly caused by the stupidity of the main characters.This movie was what you might call plot heavy, and while some say this is its biggest asset, it is also its downfall. Everyone comments that it is just like Seven, and I can't disagree there. The basic idea is just like Seven.However, the screenwriters failed to hammer out the little details of plot, and this is where it all falls apart. Having just finished watching the movie twenty minutes ago, I feel I have everything fresh in my head. So here goes, a list of plot holes in this movie.1. The biggest and best hole is that the two characters trapped in the bathroom had no less than eight hours to figure a way out, and plenty of tools at their disposal. Yes, one of them had a family that was being kept hostage, but they could've turned off the lights or something. Also, whenever Adam or Larry try to saw through the chains, they always go at it like they were trying to saw off a tree branch. I'm sure that if they'd had a little more patience and kept their cool, they would have been able to figure out how to get through thick chains or locks with even a thin-bladed saw. Every chain has a weak link, just like this movie.2. Danny Glover's character and partner are complete idiots when they zero in on the perp's lair. Why don't they call for backup? Once they have the place in sight, and know the guy's there, why not call for backup even then? Why didn't they bring in their radios or cell phones? How could the perp take a shotgun blast and get right back up (or if he was faking, how could he fall at exactly the right moment). And more importantly, WHY DID GLOVER'S CHARACTER NOT JUST SHOOT THE BASTARD WHEN HE HAD THE CHANCE, HAD A SHOTGUN ON HIM AND THE GUY IN THE CHAIR WAS GONNA BE OK? He had a split second there, and didn't even bother.3. Okay, by the end of the movie we've discovered that Zepp had poison in his blood. Huh? What kind of poison was that again? It's never explained, except that it is supposed to be slow acting. Does that mean it's slow acting as in a matter of hours, days, or weeks? Because if it isn't going to kill him in the next day or two, then what's the big rush??? Zepp then has plenty of time to figure out a way around the poison instead of holding the Good Doc's family at gunpoint. Yeesh.4. Seeing Glover's detective with all the stories pinned up on the wall gave me the impression that the other cops had already given up finding Jigsaw, or that all the other crimes were already 'solved' to the police's satisfaction. Just how else is it that the rogue detective is the only one still chasing Jigsaw? We've seen from serial murder cases here in the U.S. that the police rarely give up, even after 30 years.5. By the end of the movie, it's revealed that the killer had an inoperable brain tumor, hence the motivation for trying to make others appreciate life more. Okay, I can buy all that appreciating life stuff, but what I can't buy is that someone who has a brain tumor would be functioning well enough to create all these complex schemes and carry them out without getting caught at least ONCE. Just what kind of brain tumor was that again? Was it malignant or benign...because if it's malignant, then the Jigsaw would have died after only a few victims (it's in the brain, after all), or he would be a vegetable. (And there would't be years of stories to make about him for the detective to put on his wall!) If it's benign, then there's no fuss.6. And the worst ending of all time. Just how in the blazes does a person lie absolutely still on the floor of a dirty bathroom for hours on end? Especially a person with a brain tumor! I'd really like to know what part of the brain that tumor's on, guys, because some parts of the brain, when touched or pushed on by a stimulus (such as a tumor might be!) will actually make your limbs move, or make you say a certain word! It's been scientifically proved.Jesus Christ, do not see this movie. It would be an offense to the intelligence of Koko the Gorilla, let alone a normal human being. (And Koko likes breasts too!) Possibly the only redeeming value of this flick is that it has great camp and after you figure out how dumb all the characters really are, you can start enjoying it for being bad.\",\n",
              " 'The moment David Lean makes you aware you are in the hands of a master comes early on in \"Lawrence of Arabia.\" Lawrence (Peter O\\'Toole) holds a lit match close to his lips and with one quick puff of air blows it out. Before the action is even completed, however, Lean has cut to a shot of a desert vista, with the sun slowly rising over the lip of the horizon. It\\'s one of the most famous elliptical edits in cinema history, second maybe only to the bone/spaceship cut in \"2001: A Space Odyssey.\" And it\\'s only the first of countless memorable moments in \"Lawrence of Arabia.\" The appeal of David Lean epics has always been his ability as a director to maintain an equilibrium between the scope of his films and the characters in them. Character development is never sacrificed to massive set pieces or knock-your-socks-off action sequences. \"Lawrence of Arabia\" has these elements too, but at heart it\\'s a character study of one remarkable man. Lean seemed to understand that impressive landscapes alone are not inherently interesting; but if you place a fascinating character among those impressive landscapes, you can have movie magic.\"Lawrence\" feels unlike other historical epics of its time. In most \"big\" films--I\\'m thinking of movies like \"Ben-Hur,\" \"Spartacus,\" \"Cleopatra,\" all movies that premiered roughly around the same time as \"Lawrence\"--one gets the sense that directors framed compositions based on how much they were able to fit into their widescreen lenses. One rarely sees characters filmed from anything closer than a medium shot, and usually the background is stuffed to overflowing with garish art direction. Everything feels static and wooden. But in \"Lawrence,\" Lean keeps his frames constantly alive by juxtaposing huge landscape shots with extreme close-ups of actor faces. In one especially brutal scene, after a battle that results in the slaughter of many people, the action cuts to a close-up of O\\'Toole, looking panicked and crazed, gripping a bloody knife in his hand as if he\\'s reluctant to drop it, obviously both disturbed and titillated by the carnage he just witnessed. It\\'s moments like that---not just an impressive battle scene but a character\\'s reactions to the results of that scene---that set \"Lawrence\" apart from other standard epics.And of course, I have to reserve space in my review for the performance of Mr. O\\'Toole. He is perhaps my favorite actor, not one of the most prolific, but certainly one of the most unpredictable. He has a flair for choosing eccentric characters that give him almost unlimited room in which to perform. He carries \"Lawrence of Arabia\" almost singlehandedly on his slim shoulders. That\\'s not to say the supporting cast isn\\'t great, but O\\'Toole towers above them all. O\\'Toole understands that the most influential figures in history could also be the most difficult and ruthless when they needed to be, and he gives Lawrence an incredibly complex characterization, leaving his audience in doubt as to whether he should be worshiped or feared, or perhaps both.Lean would never direct an equal to \"Lawrence of Arabia\" again. His later films are certainly more than watchable, and \"A Passage to India\" is even quite remarkable in its own way, but we would never get another \"Lawrence.\" Even more reason to appreciate it now.My Grade: A+',\n",

Although it is a Western movie (a type which I am not too fond of) the movie is bright, witty, and entertaining as compared to the typical drab, dull Western. Val Kilmer makes the movie with his portrayal of Southern gentleman turned drunken gunslinger = Doc Holliday. In one week I watched the movie a dozen times. Obsessive? Yes, I admit to it.

              " 'This movie is a blockbuster by the book. A good looking guy, a very good looking girl, super cool teleporting ability and bad guy Samuel L Jackson kicking some jumpers ass. I have to admit that Hayden Christensen is not one of the best actors there is, and his acting flexibility could be compared only with wood. But then all the fancy locations he teleports himself to and the lavish life he lives makes his character quite likable (and enviable for that matter).The scene where he just flips the channel over, totally indifferent at the sight of the drowning people apparently has stirred some people\\'s conscience. Let\\'s be realists. Put yourself in his position what would you do? Leave your perfect luxurious high life and go save people. I don\\'t think so...Besides, he is not the only one, are there any other Jumpers saving peoples lives? Well...NO, because they are too busy trying to save their own ones from the Paladins. Who kill Jumpers, as we find out, but (a major plot hole) the fact that \"only God can be all places at all times\" is not that good a reason to go around slaughtering them people. Hopefully the sequel will shed some light on that.Then, there is Jamie Bell, the best performance in the movie. Although some of his actions weren\\'t quite reasonable, his character has a personality and credibility to it. The scene with the Mercedes-unbelievable, yet what was the point of it. Next to that Rachel Bilson\\'s little high school sweetheart looked like a poorer version of the O.C\\'s Summer. High morals, deep love, I don\\'t want to know; no; I want to know... Sounds familiar?

              " \"Just watched The Town. It's not too bad, but lacks a certain something. It's not as good as Heat (Michael Mann's masterpiece), but is more accessible. I read some trivia that it had to be cut quite a bit, which might explain why some of feels a bit too forced at times.The plot is pretty simple: bank robbers, a girl, cops and so on. It's a little unbelievable, but not so much that you scoff at it.Ben Affleck, who I previously rated as a completely overrated actor both acts and directs. He does okay, but nothing special in either role. Affleck's character is supposed to be an intelligent, caring, sensitive hardcore thief, but it's completely out of place. These are men who rob and aren't afraid to shoot their way out of a corner. Having the main character as a really decent guy who just seems to be killing time robbing banks defies belief. The other characters are two dimensional, but server well enough. Rebecca Hall does quite well as the love interest.There's overtones of a deeper storyline going on, such as the florist who seems to run things, but it is only revealed towards the end, and not much is made of it. Maybe that was among the things that got cut, and if so it was a bad choice. It comes up as quite a significant plot point, but is given only superficial treatment. A similar example that worked well was Jack Nicholson's character in The Departed. A director's cut would be worth a look at, although I don't think that the material would support a much longer film.The actions scenes are okay, but Affleck seems to waffle a little bit. There's a scene where the robbers seem to hesitate for quite a long time before opening fire at some cops. If they're as hardcore as they're supposed to be, they should just get into it. It's another minor flaw that weakens the overall feel of the movie. See Heat for how to really take down the cops in a situation like that. However, they're done well enough to maintain interest.I keep mentioning Heat because the films are very similar in a lot of ways. Heat is by far the better film overall, although it's more cerebral and The Town is easier to digest as a throwaway flick. Where Heat set the standard, The Town kind of wanders in it's shadow. The director's cut might help address that, but it remains to be seen.Overall, it's okay. Worth a 7 out of 10 for a breezy action film. Unfortunately, outside of the action sequences, the film lags significantly, but the pace is brisk and it flows quite well.\",\n",
              " \"I am trying to remember at least one character in Silver Linings Playbook who is not crazy in some way. You know, what we call a normal person, who is not or was not a patient in a mental institution, is not on psychotic medication, is not going to shrinks or a shrink himself, has no mania or obsession, does not live his or her life according to canned solutions prescribed by psychiatrists. Actually there may be one - Dolores, the mother of the deranged home where much of the action happens, splendidly acted by Jacki Weaver who also is hinted to be the deus-ex-machina of the sophisticated intrigue of rehabilitation of her son Pat (Bradley Cooper, much better than in any other film I saw him before) out of the mental institution where his stay seems to have been caused more by legal reasons than by health troubles. In the process of getting back his life, which includes for some reasons (never explained) getting back his cheating wife who was at the origin of all his troubles he will meet a new love (Jennifer Lawrence - great looks, average acting, but then she is really only 22). It's just that the Pat's system of reference (as the one of other characters in the film) is so much deformed by the stereotypes of therapy and legalism that seem to rule over the life of the heroes that only the rules of Hollywood good-feeling scripts succeed in bringing together the intrigue towards the end.It is certainly my problem that I am not a big fan of suburbs drama or of romantic comedies. It is the problem of the film that it cannot offer credible solutions to the problems of the characters. If this was real life there would be no happy character in this film. They live in times of economic uncertainty, lose jobs or run in-secure businesses. Family lives are buried in boredom and mediocrity. They are stuck in unhappy marriages. They are on medication. Even their American football teams do not do too well, and sport events turn into violent incidents with ugly racist facets. The aspiration to a positive attitude seems to be imposed and artificial. It's mean drama packed in the artificial wrapping of therapy and optimism, but the source of optimism is not clear. It sounds and looks superficial and artificial.There are many details to like in Silver Linings Playbook. Dialogs are extremely well written and acting is so natural that you feel that you are present in the suburb home, and that the characters are folks like the ones you met yesterday. You even forget that Robert De Niro is the actor who played uncounted number of gangsters, his maniac focus is so well targeted here to the obsessions for football and betting. Director David O. Russell makes the best of the neurotic ambiance and temperament of his characters and eventually drives the viewers in caring about them. It was not a bad film, despite the amount of clich√©s that outnumber the moments of real emotion, but I left the screening with a feeling of dis-orientation - serious problems are dealt with the wrong approach. A little bit like the issues the characters in the film have to face and the way they try to solve them.\",\n",

              " 'Try not to be fooled by what you might read about it, hear about it or recall how it was sold; veteran American director Steven Soderbergh\\'s film \"Magic Mike\" is about a lot more than what it seems from a perspective of face value. Depicting unemployment; later covering drug addiction and dropping subtle references to the behaviour of the banks in recent years as well as the global financial situation throughout - the film is much, much more than an hour and a half of renowned photogenic male actors removing garments of clothing. Set across one long, hot Florida summer, the film is a taut and engaging character piece about a group of men and their attitudes towards life; women and then one another.The film begins with a playful entr√©e: the leader, and most charismatic member, of a Florida based all-male stripping troupe stands by himself on stage in a packed club and attempts to gear the all-female audience into an enthusiastic frenzy just prior to their latest show. That man is a certain \"Dallas\", played by Matthew McConaughey, and the women in front of whom he performs the pre-show ritual are probably amateur actors themselves drafted in as extras genuinely in the ruptures of excitement they need to be for the scene to work. Thus, a neat element of cinema v√©rit√© is lent to immediate proceedings. But the film cuts away from anything involved in the show to what seems like the following morning, and we\\'re in someone\\'s apartment as they get up and get dressed. This character is the titular \"Magic\" Mike (Tatum), a well-built individual in his late twenties who has played host to two women overnight but has gone far enough to forget one of their names.The man oozes a sort of brash masculinity on top of this apparent attitude towards the opposite sex; a construction site worker with a large car that\\'s cross-pollinated between a truck and a jeep, he berates the fresh blood who\\'re there for their first day on account of wearing wimpy looking trainers. This fresh blood is Adam, played by English actor Alex Pettyfer; a young man aged nineteen who gets paired with Mike on day one before eventually coming to form a bond with him. Adam lives with his older sister, but struggles with finding work and earning money; indeed, it is Mike who discovers Adam lied during his application regarding certain construction skills he does not possess. At home, he speaks to his sister as to how he would take most jobs \\x96 a decent impersonation of Austrian actor-turned-politician Arnold Schwarzenegger sees him even contemplate voice-over acting, in fact things are alluded to as to be so bad that he steals cans of soda from the communal construction site cooler.Fate sees him bump into Mike one evening amidst the many bars and restaurants of this Florida city and its nightlife, a chance meeting which opens his eyes to the fact Mike moonlights as a male stripper and is busy scouring the nightclubs distributing fliers for the show that night. Given his employment status, Adams tags along with Mike to help at the club during the show: menial stuff, such as cleaning up and getting the props ready. Backstage, he meets the half-a-dozen or so other guys in the group and is generally the fall guy to their pranks and windups; indeed, the whole zone is over-cut with this fear factor upon entry as McConaughey towers above our Adam whilst holding a flaming torch on stage as he practises for a routine. Things peak when an injury befalls one of the crew and Adam ends up out there live on stage performing. To his surprise, he enjoys it but he enjoys more the camaraderie with the guys and the money he made.From these beginnings, the film spreads its wings in dipping in and out of both Adam and Mike\\'s lives \\x96 perfectly balancing either tale as one man comes to slip deeper into the world of loose women and casual drug use from an initially shy, stoic position and another\\'s gradual realisation that how he\\'s been living perhaps isn\\'t how he wants to be in a number of years\\' time. Adam\\'s sister, the stone faced Brooke (Horn) and voice of reason in Adam\\'s existence, enters Mike\\'s world and we observe her sensible, empowered and ultimately caring side ease him away from the anonymous, fatuous relationships epitomised by his first scene. The film is a richly rewarding character piece, much more than what one might be willing to merely dismiss it as based on face value and something we can genuinely place with the best of what Soderbergh has produced.',\n",

              " \"It's definitely something to see when watching a film that kick-started a lot of Hollywood's contemporary stars. Although Will Smith was already a popular sensation with his hit TV series The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air (1990-1996), this would be Smith's first entry into the action genre of films, thus having to never turn back after that. Martin Lawrence was pretty much in the same seat except that he didn't have as much notoriety as Smith. However, this film would too have Lawrence jump into the action film typecast role. Then there's the biggest realization of all. Other than directing a number of music videos, this would end up being the first film helmed by action director Michael Bay. It's interesting that there wasn't even a transition for this man. Straight from music to action blockbusters. Not even a TV movie before this, he must have had some connections.The plot follows a drug heist headed by mastermind Fouchet (Tch√©ky Karyo) where two cops who grew up together through childhood, Mike Lowrey (Will Smith) and Marcus Burnett (Martin Lawrence) only have a couple days to figure out where the deal to sell the drugs is going down. The only way these two can get the information is by protecting eyewitness Julie Mott (T√©a Leoni), who happened to be at the wrong place at the wrong time. For three writers consisting of Michael Barrie, Jim Mulholland (who both wrote for comedy sketch shows for Dave Letterman) and Doug Richardson (Die Hard 2 (1990)), the script actually has nothing that stands out as something without good quality. Will Smith and Martin Lawrence have energetic chemistry and work off each other well. Both also properly emote at the right times and give the right amount of clues to the audience on how each one grew up compared to each other. Will Smith is the smooth, calm and collected one. Even when he's mad, he's still calm. Martin Lawrence plays the opposite; a hyper, loud and rambunctious married man.Plus, there's a slew of other casting choices that make each scene worthwhile. Theresa Randle (a popular actress during this decade) plays Marcus' wife named Theresa (oddly enough). Joe Pantoliano plays Mike and Marcus' captain on the force that definitely acts like one. And then there's Nestor Serrano and Julio Oscar Mechoso who play another pair of cops who work along side Mike and Marcus. The only actor who isn't interesting in their role is Tch√©ky Karyo as Fouchet. Aside from trying to get his plan into action without being caught and speaking with his foreign accent, there's not much to say about his performance. Sure, Karyo is an unfeeling man with no conscious but much of his scenes don't involve him interacting directly with the main leads for the majority of the time. It just feels like there's a disconnect. Other than that, Will Smith and Martin Lawrence have some very comical exchanges. Plus, with the film having an R rating, they both can really unleash their thoughts uncensored.T√©a Leoni as Julie also adds some inventive scenes that aren't usually exploited in the buddy cop genre films. Although this film is in that vein, it doesn't feel so much like that here. Does the Julie character act with courage - yeah but does she do it because it's needed - no. It's always good to have a headstrong female character but here, Julie is just there to get Marcus and Mike hot headed. Then there's the action and special effects to this film. From what it looks like, this movie looked like it used no CGI, just practical effects. The action is also abundant as well with plenty of fistfights, shootouts and an occasional explosions. Which again, are all real looking. It's funny to see a movie directed by Michael Bay and see a movie done completely with practical effects and infrequent explosions. It just doesn't feel like the same guy everyone knows of today.However, the cinematography shot by Howard Atherton (best known for Fatal Attraction (1987)) isn't anything to cheer about. There are some camera shots that capture the Miami setting, but much of it is closed quarters. Whether it be in someone's home or warehouse, the angles from inside just don't suffice. There are a number of slow-motion shots (most likely due to Bay's request) that look good but again don't always stand out. Finally the music was an enjoyable listening experience. Composing the film score was Mark Mancina who had his first successful music release with Speed (1994) and then Fair Game (1995). Here, Mancina thankfully has a main theme for the franchise using guitar and what sounds like islander type drums. Considering the setting and who is starring in the film, it sounds appropriate. The action cues, which sound familiar to that of Trevor Rabin (but not entirely synthetic), are also lively enough to match the sequences that are displayed on screen. It's at those points; more percussion is used along with strings and horns. It is certainly effective. It's a fun watch.The plot's main villain isn't well defined and the cinematography is rather plain looking but the rest is wholesomely entertaining. Will Smith and Martin Lawrence have peppy chemistry along with a number of other cast members. The catchy music and action sequences coalesce nicely too.\",\n",

The action was fantastic, the characters were portrayed very well, and the humor was spread throughout to break the tension.

Instead of accepting that these kind of stories is all about fantasy & giving the audience a fun thrill ride, they try like maniacs to anchor them in reality & waste half the time on excessive talking & presenting \"plausible\" scientific explanations. Anybody with knowledge about this genre knows that such mumbo jumbo never makes the audience connect more, it totally works against its purpose. So it\\'s a mystery to me that movie makers who are able to spend millions of dollars on their productions continually fail to understand basic facts about good screen writing.In \\'Hulk\\' the back story is presented very quick in the beginning, which I thought was good, but unfortunately this does not lead into a fun & fast paced action movie. Instead it almost comes to a full stop for about 40 minutes that is filled with romantic nonsense & lots of psychobabble. And when the action finally starts to unfold the development is still very slow, and it\\'s only in the last half hour this really feels like a movie about the incredible Hulk.

That\\'s because the film basically focuses on the Gatsby-Daisy love affair and avoids going too deeply into any philosophical/psychological areas that the novel tries to bring to light. Yes, it is a lavish production that would continue to be so even if the 3D glasses were eliminated, which they should have been. Before seeing the film, I had doubts about the sound track which included compositions by Jay Z. Oddly enough, the sound track worked and was not distracting. However, I wonder why director, Baz Luhrmann, decided to add modern music to a film obsessed with recreating the atmosphere of the 1920s. Perhaps financial reasons were behind it, or maybe he just wanted to lure in the younger audience.The acting was good enough. DiCaprio played a kind of Gatsby but failed to bring out that sense of melancholy and longing that you find in most Fitzgerald characters. His Gatsby was interesting if lacking in depth. I had trouble with Carey Mulligan as Daisy. She was a little too \"girl next doorish\" to make us believe that she was Gatsby\\'s obsession. She simply lacked the psychotic proclivities that the novel\\'s Daisy possesses and which underpin the somewhat confusing psychological attraction between the two main characters. Nick (Tobey Maguire) was more simple-minded than in the novel.But the people I saw the movie with, and who were not familiar with the novel, thought the movie was quite good. I can see their point and almost wish I hadn\\'t read the novel a number of times. So I would recommend this movie for those not familiar with the novel and would warn those who know the novel about coming away from it with a sense of being unfulfilled.',\n",
              " 'I must admit that I went into the theatre almost completely biased and determined to dislike this movie and Matthew Macfadyen as Mr. Darcy because who on earth could live up to Colin Firth\\'s gorgeously arrogant and aristocratic portrayal of Fitzwilliam? I tried to dislike it, I tried to find fault. Damn it all, blast and wretch!! Urgh, all right, all right, it\\'s good, it\\'s GOOD...!! Keira Knightley, i think, is a better choice for playing Lizzy because while Jennifer Ehle is a good actress and fairly attractive, Keira shows Lizzy\\'s rough edges and unconventional beauty in the Victorian era. And I know it sounds weird, but Keira\\'s body type fits Lizzy better I think. Jennifer has gorgeous flawless smooth white skin and is just barely plump-ish, and has perfect curls; to me this does NOT seem like Lizzy Bennett. Now Keira Knightley has a slightly almost ruddy complexion, slightly messy hair, is tall and lanky, and has pretty much no boobs. Jennifer, has boobs. It may seem weird, but it makes sense.By the end of the movie, I loved Matthew Macfadyen even though I felt like I was betraying my dear Colin Firth. As far as the image of arrogance and self-importance, Colin succeeds better. But when it comes to Darcy informing Lizzy of his love for her, Macfadyen is better in that he really looked ticked off that he\\'s tried so hard not to like her but he just can\\'t help himself and that makes him even more ticked off. I could totally see the thoughts of \"I\\'ve tried SO FREAKING HARD to not even like you, let alone, love you, and I still do, it\\'s against my better judgement, you\\'re beneath me, it would be socially stupid of me to marry you, but god help me, I love you and I want to marry you.\"Mrs. Bennett, haha, she\\'s great: a fidgety scheming nervous wreck of a woman. Wonderful. ^_^ Mr. Bennett was delightful in his own small role: laid back and does well with his few little funny bits. Judi Dench was wonderful as Lady Catherine de Bourg, although I kept thinking of her as the crotchety and full-of-vinegar Armande in \"Chocolat\". ^_^ He\\'s ridiculous, but I felt really bad for poor Mr. Collins because no one really ever listens to him, not even his wife. Kitty and Lydia were wonderfully giggly Victorian teeny-bopper flirts.I did wonder a little at the cinematography, as far as closeups went. It just seemed like every time the camera panned to another person, it would zoom in just a little when they spoke, and then when the camera panned back again, it would do its little zoom think again.Costumes were great, even though I\\'ve always detested most of the Victorian styles for women. Darcy still looks good...Scenery was nice, especially Darcy\\'s house. Good freakin\\' LORD, that place is HUGE, and sooo NICE! Which reminds me of another character analysis: Tamzin Merchant as Georgiana was adorable! And the little knowing look she gave to her brother when Lizzy was in the room, well, it was perfect. ~_^ So yes, even though it pains me and I feel disloyal to A & E and Colin Firth, I must give this film a 9 out of 10 for wonderful awkward moments, superb acting, and the most-perfect-to-date portrayal of Jane Austen\\'s novel I have ever seen.thespian wishes, ~*kitty Walsh*~',\n",

We don't learn how he was able to do any of it, but no explanation is needed because OMG did you see that car.Now let's pause briefly for another snippet of a weird, uninvolving and unresolved subplot about the wife... and straight back to Tom, faffing about on the outside of a big building, scampering around with a pair of customised washing-up gloves.

And they're not programmed with personalities.Tom Cruise is a strange one. He makes these hugely narcissistic films but doesn't seem to be offering any performances worthy of his own faith in himself.

The movie has an ace performer and newly discovered of incredible amount talent is none but James Franco. He has given his heart to this film. It's a challenging role with minimum dialogs and pretty much expressions only. The movie literally turns you into Ralston's character and makes you feel the helplessness of that deadly circumstance. The movie is well written and well built character of Ralston with it's heart-felting performance by Franco keeps your mouth open. Coming to the score of the movie I can say truly that I came into tears especially in that last scene when Franko drinks water from the muddy pond,gets up holding the water bottle,runs and calls for help. And finally those guys looks back and runs to him. Its is a moment that captures your heart and eyes get wet every time you see it. Apart from Franco and Boyle, a huge accomplishment by A R Rahman who has given a truly Emotional and Inspirational score which gives a feeling that you have achieved your life back over your death just now. This is a kind of movie rather experience which stays in your heart for long time even if you want you to wipe it out. I can tell u one thing for sure, this is kind of Inspirational and Important movie (like Shawshank Redemption) which u definitely wouldn't have watched in recent past years.\",\n",
              " '\"Van Helsing\" starts off with a sort of homage to the Universal monster films of the 1930s, with improved visual effects. You\\'ll have to see it yourself to know what i mean. But it also sets the tone for an action film that rarely lets up. In a good way that is. Hugh Jackman might have a Harrison Ford-like future if he wants. Imagine a good looking guy, who can handle the big budget action films, but with more depth of character than Ford has ever brought.(Possible Spoiler)This Van Helsing, not to be confused with the better known Abraham, is a 007 for the late 19th century. Fighting larger than life villains (Mr. Hyde, The Wolfman, etc.) under the auspices of an organization (the Catholic Church) protecting the world from disaster. Only now he must fight his deadliest enemy, Dracula and his minions.Despite the length (over 2hrs 15min), the pace rarely falters to blandness. Credit this to director Stephen Sommers. Seems more confident in his creative choices then in The Mummy (the less said about the sequel, the better). Granted, Kate Beckinsale did nothing in this film that Rachel Weisz couldn\\'t do as well, so maybe a little money could have been saved. And like The Mummy, Sommers needs a comic sidekick. In this case, David Wenham as the cowardly friar making weapons like Q to help out Van Helsing. Wenham and Jackman\\'s interplay goes well, as they rise above their dialogue. No such luck between Jackman and Beckinsale.But this isn\\'t an actor\\'s or a writer\\'s piece; this is an ILM piece, and boy do they come through. The effects are a standout, with the best computer-generated morphing/transformation sequences i\\'ve seen in quite a while. Thumbs up for the sound effects and editing crews as well. The formula seems familiar after you leave the theater. But while you\\'re watching, you don\\'t care. You\\'re just enjoying the ride.

I had a great time because it had all the winning characteristics of a Hollywood effort. So it meant that my Sunday was going to be fun.We all know the legend and the original story and this version captures it perfectly and gives it a unique look. Tim Burton is a master when creating unique realms. Depp delivers a very good performance. You know what to expect... Mrs. Ricci is hot and looks ... unique. She's always hot. Christopher Walken gives a very creepy performance and I bought his role as a villain.My advice would be to watch this as mindless entertainment, or if you are a Tim Burton - Johnny Depp fan, or if you just want to have a good time with a commercial effort about a creepy legend. Creepy in Hollywood's style.\",\n",

              " \"Released late September of 2012, The Master is the second most recent Paul Thomas Anderson film. It comes after his most critically acclaimed work, There Will Be Blood and had a lot to live up to after TWBB proved Anderson's skill as a technical director as well as a screenwriter. Expectations appeared high in movie circles in the upcoming release of this movie. The film appeared to polarise audiences and understandably so from it's unusual and almost eccentric approach to storytelling. The film follows a sailor (Joaquin Pheonix) in Post-WW2 America and his relationship with a cult, specifically it's leader Lancaster Dodd (Philip Seymour Hoffman). The film deals with the contrast in their personalities and while at first they appear as entirely different individuals, their similarities as two humans desiring basic emotions - love, respect and affection is highlighted through Anderson's subtle abilities to educate and inform his audiences. The two main actors' performances are absolutely incredible. Joaquin is only becoming a more impressive actor as he takes on difficult role after another and the late Seymour Hoffman delivers one of the finest roles in his outstanding career. The two's chemistry is unmatched in any recent character driven movie I have seen and I am certain scenes between the two such as Freddie's Processing will go down in film history in the future. Joaquin's ability to deliver such powerful emotions through creative and uncommon ways more so than solely through vocals is refreshing. From his hunched over and tight posture when offended to the soul crushing despair in his eyes when discussing his family, his performance is near shockingly realistic and he should be commended for such efforts.What may be unappreciated to a majority of viewers is the technical aspect of the film. Paul Thomas Anderson takes credit of directing and writing the film and his skills show here as equally as in TWBB. The cinematography is absolutely beautiful, shot in 70mm for a majority of the film, the wide and majestic shots really stand out and add to the film's oddities while suiting a large majority of the spacious settings and the characters' frequent movements. Also the use of the fish eye lens to give a spherical dimension to some of the more intimate moments really helps bring you into the actions within. The film opens to a dramatic wide opening shot of the sea as the boat powers through it, churning up waves as Jonny Greenwood's stellar score runs in the background, setting the dramatic and powerful tone to follow throughout. Anderson really shows his ability to deliver character background in a short space of time here, for example in the opening we learn of numerous key traits of Freddie's in the first ten minutes. We first see Freddie in a U-Boat, looking disgruntled and emotionally torn. A quick cut brings us to his feet, he sits on a beach creating an alcoholic concoction from fruit on a tropical tree nearby and chemicals he has expected to have taken from the ship which he serves on, first introducing us to his massive drinking problem. Another cut and Anderson presents us with a short but vital scene presenting Freddie's social issues, unable to fit in and severely sexually frustrated. The other soldiers have created a lady out of the sand and Freddie examines it behind the others, pushing through the crowd and fondling the formation for an awkwardly lengthy period of time as the men look on at the bizarre sight. Anderson is a master of delivering detail without the use of dialogue and solely through what he shows through the camera and in his brilliant screen writing. Overall I adore the film. I find almost every aspect to be worked on and considered to a significantly high degree and although the many complaints of the lengthy run time and lack of dialogue in areas, causing viewers to become uninterested or unfocused, to appreciate the film's beauty I feel that these less dialogue-driven moments are vital. The film's vague and indefinite ending has too sparked off a lot of distaste surrounding the movie while I see it as extremely touching and a bold unconventional move on Anderson's part. I can only hope that more film's in the future are of this calibre and provide new and interesting ideas to modern cinema.\",\n",
              " \"STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS is the second film in the rebooted STAR TREK series, following on from the lacklustre first. The good news is that this one's a definite improvement, a straight-up action flick with a fast pace that takes your mind off the less-than-impressive moralising and character development of the cast. It starts off very well indeed, with Kirk and co. at the mercy of an unknown mega-villain running rings around Star Fleet, before turning into a typical outer space adventure in the second half.As an ensemble production, few of the cast get a real look-in, with an annoyingly 'heroic' Chris Pine failing to get the viewer on side (he was much better in UNSTOPPABLE) as Kirk and Zachary Quinto a bit stiff as Spock. Simon Pegg is better in his usual comic relief role (the same as his one in the MISSION IMPOSSIBLE franchise) while newcomer Alice Eve is a bit too chipper. It's left to the old pros like Bruce Greenwood and Peter Weller to really excel, although Benedict Cumberbatch is fine too as the villain of the piece, lit to look very much like an alien. Watch out for a great little cameo late on. The rest is a mash-up of heroism, endless CGI spectacle, and ordinary plotting.\",\n",
              " \"I found the messages of the film to be very confusing, as if the scriptwriter was unsure whether he was aiming to show society is too obsessed with paedophiles that we risk condemning the innocent or that paedophiles do deserve to meet a sticky end. The premise of 'Hard Candy' involves fourteen-year-old Hayley meeting up with Jeff, a thirty-two-year-old fashion photographer whom she has been chatting with on-line. Initially, the two seem the best of friends although Jeff is unsure of how to treat Hayley given her age. And then he realises that she is no innocent young girl but someone with a very dangerous vendetta against him.To be fair to the actors, they do give good performances. Patrick Wilson, as Jeff, portrays the character to have ambiguous motives towards the girl while Ellen Page, who plays Hayley, delivers a vindictive, almost manic edge to her depiction although she was a bit too old for the role and that took away the shock of seeing someone so young participating in such violence.The problem with this film, as I said before, is that it wasn't sure what it intended the audience to take home from it. Pity the paedophile? Children ask to be molested? Just looking at child pornography doesn't make you a real pervert? Hayley is a bad, bad girl? That's what it seemed the film wanted us to think. 'Hard Candy' works on the premise that Hayley is the antagonist while Jeff is the 'shades of grey' protagonist but those who have seen the effects of molestation has on children would argue that he deserved his fate the minute he knowingly invited a child (and yes, a fourteen-year-old is still very much a child not matter how flirtatious they are) back to his home.This film would have been quite powerful had Hayley subjected Jeff to all her tricks only to realise he didn't realise her age and he would never touch a child, in a scenario similar to where vigilantes murder the wrong person leaving a bitter taste in their idea of justice and opening up the complexities of taking the law into one's own hands. However, when it is revealed he has images of child porn in his house and we know from the onset he was aware of how old (or rather, how young) Hayley was, it is very hard to feel pity for him and his plight. Perhaps it's just me but I don't want to empathise with paedophiles. Not to mention, it is even harder to feel sympathy for Jeff when he had so many opportunities to escape yet to chose to stay at the house to pay Hayley back for what she put him through.There is also little reflection on why Hayley does all this. What tips a seemingly normal fourteen-year-old kid to become so twisted and vengeance-driven? How did she manage to solve the missing child's case yet the police are still floundering? We are, after all, talking about a kid at an age where she's barely allowed the cross the street by herself let alone gallivant around the city, solving major crimes like a junior, psycho version of Jessica Fletcher.What could have been an excellent film that draws out many ethical debates on vigilantism and the dangers of proclaiming people 'guilty until proved innocent', it's just a mess that seems to try to elicit empathy for the last group of people on this planet who deserve it.\",\n",
              " \"Sequels have a bad name. There's reason for that. This one, however, can be deceptive: It starts out good. The very opening? Magnificent. It's not unlikely that the casting people of Smallville had just seen that bit when they chose how to fill that role. Sadly, it doesn't last more than the minute or so. After that, there are glimpses, ideas, and here and there, it almost gets to be great. Alas, the rest of it weighs down, and I'd say that the ending is tasteless beyond anything that was in the first. Subtlety seems to have been the initial victim in the onslaught of graphic death in this. Verhoeven gave us a satire, where the social commentary flowed much smoother... like honey, although (intentionally) bitter. This contains dialog so exposition- and explain-happy, one's initial reaction if viewing the two in succession is pure disbelief. Granted, it's not going to go over people's heads... even if they're laying down... but is quality second to profit? ...well, it shouldn't be. This takes the route that other movies that join a franchise in progress have, where the predecessor asked the audience to take something seriously: It makes fun of it. While this goes for a cynicism similar to the real RoboCop film, and clearly does attempt to recreate the certain undefinable thing of it, it just never gets across the same bleakness. Some of the time, it seems to almost parody the original, and encourage us to lighten up with the visions of what may come, at other points it tries too hard at the dark tone, and becomes quite tough to swallow. It didn't even offer an imaginative villain. Did anyone not see coming what the form was going to be? Furthermore, it's got to do with narcotics... how surprising, since the 'bad guy' in the majority of entertainment pieces with a story were around this period wasn't at all a drug lord, a dealer, or a variation thereof. This didn't have to turn out this way. Irvin Kershner, director of the best(definitely in my opinion) Star Wars episode, helmed this. Frank Miller wrote for it... unfortunately, little of it was used(other of that material was included in the third), and I suggest reading the comic based on it to any fan of his. There are characters with credibility and solid writing, at least sometimes. There are interesting concepts here. There's even a bona-fide, genuine scene that can be claimed to potentially invoke emotion in the audience. Nevertheless, the final product is so that I couldn't blame anyone for only watching the one prior to this, of the cinema-released depictions of(this particular version thereof) the future of law enforcement. Maybe this is the real reason Weller passed on the third. Failing that, perhaps he started reading the script of it and decided that life's too short. I recommend this mainly to those who want the entire series, and dreamers who wish to take it in and ponder what might have been. I wouldn't rule out that this could have become one of the few and seldom occurring follow-ups that do justice to what came before them. 6/10\",\n",

Why make Miranda colder than she's ever been by taking sex out of her life and then casting her as the bad wife for causing him to stray? Yuck, how very 1950s of the writers. More topical would have been a storyline about the stress of taking care of his mother with Ahlzheimer's and the toll it takes on a marriage.Samantha was shipped off the island, hardly to be seen again. If I never believed that SJP doesn't like Kim Cattrall, I believe it now. Not only did she trash the character by giving her nothing to do and having her put on weight, she had her dressed like Joan Collins circa 1982.As for Carrie Bradshaw, I thought Sarah Jessica Parker looked great (not a wrinkle to be found) and performed beautifully. But and it's a big but, why was the Carrie plot driven by Jennifer Hudson instead of by the cast regulars? Nothing against Jennifer Hudson, but the whole story line felt forced and completely unbelievable.Where was Stanford? Did he have any lines? How do you take the most adorable character seen on the very first episode of the series and give him nothing? Wouldn't it have been great to have a little sub-plot still showing him with Marcus after all the years? And where were Anthony, Harry, Smith and Steve? All were relegated to inconsequential parts that were poorly written, edited or both.What did I like? Big - Chris Noth continues to inhabit this role in the same cool albeit less prickish manner he always has. I liked the girls in Mexico \\x96 the old chemistry shined through.

              " \"This American remake of the Japanese original exceeds expectations. A 'troubled kid' always sends alarm bells ringing \\x96 often they are written and portrayed in such a precocious way that invites deep irritation rather than sympathy. Despite plenty of opportunities to exhibit such behaviour, young David Dorfman as Aiden mainly manages to avoid this. His mother Rachel (Naomi Watts) is actually less sympathetic than he is. She is an abrasive character who is very difficult to warm to.Luckily, 'The Ring' also resists being a 'teen' movie, despite opening with two adolescent girls talking about 'this videotape that kills people'. Before long, as coincidence would have it, one of the girls has succumbed to that very curse.Overall, this is a good, spooky remake of the 1998 film. It cultivates its own unique brand of horror. Often shot in cold colours, much use is made of creeping water, blurred photographs and the everyday city portrayed as an oppressive, menacing environment. While the idea of videotapes is suddenly archaic, it actually gives the oncoming horror a nostalgic, creepy feeling that, for example, a Blu-Ray just wouldn't provide. The 'subliminal' imagery on the tape is also a very sinister, abstract series of events. You don't know what it all means, but it certainly doesn't look cheerful.Gore Verbinski's direction is very effective, building up a level of tension from less than obvious means. Views of tower-blocks, rain-swept streets and boxed-in people leading desolate lives help create an isolated world. Hans Zimmer's wonderful musical score also promotes the notion of seclusion, with echoing piano minimalism, notes like raindrops. The central idea of Rachael hearing about a videotape that kills people, and then watching the tape and inviting Aiden's father Noah (Martin Henderson) to watch it too, takes a lot of justification in logical terms and questions her intelligence. I'm not happy with the lack of explanation of this. Does she do this deliberately? In horror, stupid people do stupid things.The impenetrable images on the tape are shadowed throughout the film, providing a certain, slowly unravelling degree of clarity. And yet it isn't until the troubled Samara (Daveigh Chase) is mentioned, an adopted girl with deadly psychic abilities, who seems in spirit, to be responsible for the doings of the curse, do Aiden's 'troubles' become clearer - he has a kind of kinship with her.The standout scene, the moment the whole film has been leading up to, is a true classic horror moment. It's more spectacular than the scene in the original, but more or less retains the intimacy of Samara's singular mission: she's coming for you. First out of image of the well, then \\x96 blurred and the image fracturing \\x96 towards the television screen; then, impossibly through the screen and into reality. It's a blisteringly good moment of pure horror.\",\n",

Story is almost like a children's tale and very sentimental and many times boring - the action from start to end its gone Many jokes are too artificial that are not funny anymore. Whole storyline is boring without any real bad-ass ... Iam disgusted how somebody could ruin the whole idea that was so perfectly stared in first episode. This movie is not worth your cash. If you liked first episode storyline, action and perfect jokes you will be very disappointed from this movie.\",\n",
              " 'First off, it\\'s true that many of the phreaks and hacks the kids used in this movie were bogus but who in their right mind would put /real/ stuff in a movie such as this? I certainly wouldn\\'t. Heck, I won\\'t even tell most of my non-geek friends how to look at the Registry. People don\\'t know what they\\'re doing as it is without giving them the means to screw things up _really_ bad. You don\\'t give a small child a sharp knife and expect them to cut their food rather than themselves, right? Zheezh!My first watch of the film occurred while I was taking Cisco classes a couple years ago. A friend in my class was astounded that I\\'d never seen it. He said it was a \"staple\" of our \"diet.\" Well, it\\'s certainly a fun movie to watch and analyze if you enjoy the field and can understand the terminology. The special effects are pretty cool IMO and very intuitively geared toward people who see circuits everywhere they go - the city turning into a circuit board, for example... I was startled to see that occur just as I was thinking the same thing! The typical moviegoer might get some fun out of this movie, too, even if doing some head-scratching, and the effects might not be true to what real computers are like but they certainly are neat and give a good interpretation of what it\\'s like to be thinking inside the box (literally).Hackers was the first \"real\" movie (other than Star Trek movies of course) that I ever truly paid attention to since realizing I wasn\\'t alone in my love for computers. Before watching it I didn\\'t care about watching TV because it was a waste of my valuable computer time. Now, however, I understand the value behind such \"entertainment.\" Since this movie I\\'ve come to love a few other \"staples\" such as Lord Of The Rings, Tron, The Matrix, SwordFish, and of course the classic for all of us stuck in small spaces fighting with stupid copiers and arrogant bosses, Office Space.Regardless of whether you\\'re geared toward computers or not, though, I\\'d highly recommend this movie. It\\'s a fairly good introduction into the whole concept of the hacker mindset (insatiable curiosity, obsession with working out problems) and the whole techno subculture (or whatever it\\'s called). Looking at it from a nontechnical person\\'s standpoint, it\\'s a fun story about a bunch of good but misunderstood kids who stick together to bring down those who would otherwise manipulate the general public and thwart the minority just to get away with something unethical. And, it also helps to point out that there are indeed two types of hackers in real life - the white hat variety (such as the kids in the movie) and the black hat types (more commonly known as crackers). The media today has soooooo badly corrupted the word hacker that one can\\'t even mention the word in some places without immediately being labelled as suspect. You definitely don\\'t want to let it slip out at work, especially if you work with computers!Me, I\\'d watch it just to see that finger armor on Angelina\\'s finger and daydream about wearing it myself. Unfortunately, they simply don\\'t make that type of jewelry in size 6. Ugh. One of these days I\\'ll get into metalworking and make my own. HACK THE PLANET!!',\n",

Ronin is the only action movie you'll see and want to watch it again. Set in the narrow streets of France, Ronin delivers the most exhilarating car chases you've ever seen. And as the movie revolves around recouperating an elusive briefcase, the movie while never reaching the level of an intelligent film, it is quick and suspenseful enough to keep you glued to your chair from start to finish. With Jean Reno and Robert De Niro at their best and Natascha McElhone a blast to watch as the Irish leader in charge of getting the case, Ronin keeps twisting just enough to keep in awe until the last scene. A real directing masterpiece as it doesn't fear to break to mould of the Hollywood action genre and will make Ronin will be a hard act to follow for those who wish to make an action movie with guts.\",\n",
              " 'I saw this movie yesterday after skipping it for many times. The reason for skipping may be due to the negative reviews flooded in this site. According to me, Tourist is not a action movie. It is a Romance, Thriller flick and it satisfies me much enough.The acting of Johny Depp and Angelina is really nice. After playing such a talkative character in Pirates Series, Johnny Depp played a very underplay role here and it is nice too.Angelina is not much beautiful as she is projected in this movie. But her acting is also nice and subtle.This is a movie to watch in a boring holiday with a wine and taste to watch a different style movie.I can give 6 out of 10 for this much satisfying romance, thriller movie',\n",
              " \"While todays moviegoers are content, for some reason, to watch films with gratuitous CG that is quite often terribly executed (King Kong anyone?)but seem to think that films with great prosthetics are so yesterday.TMNT: THE MOVIE shows how superior good costumes and prosthetics are far superior to CG, the Turtle costumes are great, the faces are fantastically designed to give a full variety of expressions without being so over the top (like the predator in AVP who had far too much movement in it's face), add on to that the brilliant acting of the people in the suites, and the awesome voice acting when all put together deliver a deep sense of character and uniqueness for each of the turtles.The plot, some have criticized as being too simple, however sometimes simple is better than a plot that ends up being confusing as it tries to be complex. The plot goes like this, in NYC a silent crime wave has hit, there are no witnesses and the crimes are escalating from simple pick pockets to whole trucks of goods being stolen. The group responsible is the FOOT, a group of ninja thieves headed by the SHREDDER. A good simple plot, which the main characters become involved in when they intervene in one of the FOOT's crimes which happened to be trying to silence reporter April O'Neil who knows too much about the FOOT than they care for her to know.I won't say more just in case the reader hasn't seen this film yet. It is dark, not as violent as the comics, but the comics being aimed at an adult audience and the TV show aimed at children the Movie had to strike a balance between both and I think it did, while avoiding the bloodshed in the comics, the themes and characters are relate able to adult audiences without being cheesy. While some of the slang and street talk may not catch on very quickly with a modern younger audience but that is due to the time of when the film was made and the modern day, but it doesn't lack in cool factor. I only wish the sequels were as good, and that more modern films will take lessons from this film in how to incorporate a good story and good characters with heavy special effects be they CG, animatronic or prosthetics.\",\n",

The latter case happened with \"Goodfellas\" as it happened with \"Godfather\" and some other movies. It\\'s of course a difference of view points; but sometimes it is just confusing to me.I gave the movie three out of ten just because of the great cast and the good performance.

              " 'This movie has a simple story of a criminal who can\\'t go straight, a man who can\\'t change who he is, because of his past. Film also has a great performances by the whole cast. By Pacino that never lets us down in any of his performances. We have Sean Penn in a great part as Kleinfeld as he falls down the path of corruption that we hardly recognize him with big bald frizzy hair. Also some performances by Luis Guzman, John Lequizamo & Viggo Mortensen in some their first parts. Guzman now get lots of the best supporting parts their are. Leguizamo is a great comedian & serious actor with a career already. And Mortensen, that is one the best actors around.Directed by Brian de Palma (\"Carrie\"), this is one of the most realistic, and historic accurate pictures of life in New York City\\'s urban jungle during the late 1970\\'s/early 1980\\'s. Brian De Palma had just come off a lukewarm reception for yet another Hitchcock homage, \"Raising Cain\" and was in need of a hit to appease the studios. And so, a re-teaming with Al Pacino in an effort to recreate the magic of \"Scarface\" made commercial sense. \"Carlito\\'s Way\" was much more sombre in tone than the cinematic shotgun blast that is Scarface. It is a tragedy about how a criminal tries to go straight but is ultimately doomed from the get-go. Penelope Ann Miller (\"Adventures in Babysitting\" is great as Brigante\\'s love interest, and Luis Guzman always is a scene-stealer playing Pacino\\'s right-hand man. \"Carlito\\'s Way\" is a fantastic film that is sad in a sense, but states a sad truth. More-so, this is just fantastic entertainment pulled off by a superb performance from Pacino, and a great director Brian de Palma.Overall rating: 8 out of 10.',\n",

For example, the fight on the pier. That was never once mentioned in the book. And Jacob never saw his grandpa again in the book I believe. So all in all, this movie was almost completely off. Also, in the book, Emma has the power with fire and Olive is able to float. In the film though, Emma can float and Olive can use fire instead. The two got mixed up and that's just horrible.

              " \"This is a genuinely dreadful film, overwrought, turgid and shot entirely in close-up, like some tarted-up TV Lifetime biopic. The performances range from the bizarre (Johnny's dad) to the overly moist (the leads). Except for the Folsom scenes that bookend the film, and the scene that has Sam Phillips explaining to Johnny what makes a hit record, the movie rings false. Worse, it makes being Johnny Cash look like, well, no fun at all. It staggers from tragedy to tragedy, pausing on occasion to wipe its nose or trot out another cardboard Legends of Rock cutout (Elvis, Jerry Lee Lewis). Why has this mostly played out, waxworks genre suddenly become so fashionable? Am I the only one who experiences a genuine sense of disconnect seeing someone play Katherine Hepburn play Alice Adams? Performances become impersonations, at a time when the David Steinbergs and the Frank Gorshins (RIP) have long since vanished from the scene. Playing a Truman Capote, a Ray Charles or a Johnny Cash, at a time when most of us have a fairly recent, living memory of these celebrities requires a suspension of disbelief that I, frankly, don't find, for the most part, to be worth the candle. We await reassessments of THE GREAT CARUSO or NIGHT AND DAY (sorry- forgot the recent DE-LOVELY). Better still, a reworking, so we can see Sylvester Stallone playing Mario Lanza playing Caruso playing Rigoletto!\",\n",

There is a great focus on cannibalism and the lack of food, because everything is basically dead. I don't buy that basically everybody is driven to cannibalism. In the real world even in times of great need, the cases of cannibalism is very few. I don't think people give up and end it with suicide that often either. People tend to stick together in groups because that increases the chance of survival. No one in the film seems to be a survival expert in the movie, because I can see food everywhere in the forest.\",\n",
              " '\"Come and See\" is a beautiful film by Elim Klimov, and a smart masterpiece way to pay tribute to the 40th anniversary Russian win over Germany forces. The cinematography of the movie made me react as in to how many people were hurt during the making of the film, but also during the actual war during War World II. It is brilliant to see how Floyra changes in front of the audience, first his innocence, and then his mind. The film does a well job in depicting how brutal war is, and Floyra\\'s decision to stay in war at the end, even though he knows how brutal it is. In addition, by Klimov emphasizing on the story of this little village, the micros coping aspect makes the impact of the film bigger because it can represent any other village that was going under the same circumstances in Russia. The images of the film are devastating, and there is so much to absorb every second of the film.',\n",
              " 'Say what you like about the Bond franchise ( And in my opinion I don`t have a lot of good things to say ) but the series never came out with the old cliche of having those nasty pinko commies as the bad guys . Bond`s enemies where always the fictional SPECTRE or mad scientist types , not that this was always successful of course . But I did enjoy the ironic fact that this new Bond starts his first filmed mission with an attack on a secret USSR base . Even better in this respect is the title sequence where we see the demise of communist icons and as the story progresses we find out the bad guys are ex-communists turned quasi mafia , and the motivation of the main baddie involves a cold war betrayal . All this gives GOLDENEYE a sense of time and place , something that can`t be said for most - If any - Bond films.GOLDENEYE is a very good Bond film even if it`s not up to classics like DR NO or GOLDFINGER . The production values are certainly a million times better than what we saw in the 80s . Brosnan is fairly good but lacks that serious touch that Dalton and Connery had . The only other complaint I have is that tank sequence which is very silly and interferes with the pace of the film . The one thing that puzzled me though is the main villain . He`s played by an actor far too young to have born in the 1940s . I know Anthony Hopkins was to have been originally cast in this role but if that was the case would he have been required to have a really brutal punch up with Bond at the climax ?',\n",

              " \"Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman) is continuing his trek to Lonely Mountain, accompanying Bilbo are the 13 elves, Gandalf (Ian McKellen) the wizard, and Thorin (Richard Armitage) the King of the dwarfs. Once they find the mountain, they have to use the Key of Thorin to open a door carved into the Lonely Mountain. He must also find the Arkenstone, the royal gem of Erebor, and take on Smaug, the dragon. And he must do all this before sunset on Durin's Day. Before he gets to Lonely Mountain, there are many obstacles in Bilbo's way. He seeks refuge with Beorn (Mikael Persbrandt) and then has to fight giant spiders in Mirkwood Forest. They escape the spiders only to be arrested by the Elvin King, Thanduil. (Lee Price) Bilbo and company escapes the Elvin prison in barrels only to run into a band of Orcs. The attack is repelled by Legolas (Orlando Bloom) and Tauriel (Evangeline Lilly)Meanwhile, Gandalf has split from the group with Radagast (Sylvester McCoy) to find the Necromacer, also known as Sauron. Before getting to Lonely Mountain, Bilbo and the dwarfs must go through the burgh of Laketown with the help of Bard, (Luke Evans) to get weapons. Thorin also tries to negotiate the return of Laketown to the dwarfs, Thorin promises to share the gold from Lonely Mountain with the people of Laketown. They accept Thorin's proposal. By the time Bilbo and the dwarfs gets to Lonely Mountain, the sun is setting, and they cannot find the keyhole. Bilbo has the ring which gives him invisibility, but will he get a chance to use it against Smaug? Does Gandalf find Sauron?The last 40 minutes if the Desolation of Smaug is well worth watching. The chemistry between Freeman and Cumberbatch crackles with tension. Getting to that last 40 minutes, however is a long, hard slog. Peter Jackson has again taken a simple story, and made it a bloated, unrecognizable mess. He could have scaled back on Legolas and Tauriel, he could have scaled back on Laketown and skipped the love triangle between Legolas, Tauriel and Kili altogether, but all the minutia was there. I haven't read the Hobbit or any other Tolkien, but all the minutia made for dull watching. The problem is, every sci-fi movie since Star Wars has to be an epic trilogy, the Lord of the Rings was an epic trilogy, so the movie makers, for purely pecuniary reasons, made the Hobbit a trilogy, and it's the audience who suffers. The Hobbit movies also suffer by comparison to the Lord of the Rings trilogy which was a rich tapestry of story and characters, which built to an incredible climax, the Hobbit will never match the magic of the Lord of the Rings movies.The acting is fine, especially by Cumberbatch, Freeman, and Ian McKellen. The movie is best when the three are on screen. When the movie shifts away from the three characters they play, the movie suffers. Evangeline Lilly and Orlando Bloom do their best, but their storyline just didn't interest me. Richard Armitage is pretty forgettable as Thorin.The pacing is very slow at points, and I noticed that the landscapes, which were pretty spectacular in the first Hobbit movie, were somewhat ordinary, the CGI budget seemed mostly to be poured into the talking spiders, and Smaug, and I must say, Smaug is a special effects marvel, but still not spectacular enough to maintain a 2 hour and 20 minute movie.For more fire-breathing reviews, visit my blog, reviewswithatude.wordpress.com\",\n",

I know not everyone in the audience at the cinema felt the same and they seemed to found funny most of the dialog (laughing during the movie). It was like they were to immature to understand the sexual talk and chemistry between the couple. Like they wouldn't talk like that in their relationship, which my wife and i find is amazing the romance and passion.The acting and directing of the movie surprised us how they managed to make the book come to life. In our opinion the movie was equally as good if not better than the book.Christian and Anna were perfect characters in the movie.The books really helped improved our sex life after kids as we tend to forget we are a couple as well as parents.

Ideally France welcomes immigrants from Africa and the Middle East and really isn't the xenophobic place we see and hear about on the news.Another redundancy are all the skin scenes - man with woman, woman with woman, all long, repetitive and boring. Yes, there are some obvious combinations and groupings omitted but this film's treatment of sex is better left to the porn industry and not to reputable movie studios. I'm just an ordinary movie-goer but if you gave me the scissors I'm asking for I could make either a decent movie about sexual identity or some artistic pornography.

Beyond the complex and intriguing storyline, the editing deserves applause as well. To avoid spoilers, I won't go in depth as to why, but the editing really allows the viewer to understand such a complicated method of storytelling. Though I watched it for the first time a long time ago, I simply could not shake it from the back of my mind, and have since returned to it again and again. It's art, and n matter how many times I watch it I am consistently blown away. It's the type of film that never gets boring to revisit, as it contains so many different meanings and details to discover anew each time. While it is obviously very mentally stimulating, with it's complex plot and all, there's just so much finesse, and it is of such high quality, that it manages to be a fast watch that keeps the viewer engaged the whole way through.

              " \"I'm not a huge fan of the X-Men movies, but I love X2, First Class, DOFP, and I liked Apocalypse.The opening action sequence was pretty breathe taking. When I first saw Apocalypse on screen, I thought he looked pretty scary, I thought his scrawny creepy old man look was scary, you could tell he was ancient, and I think it would've been interesting if Bryan Singer had kept the old scrawny look for the entirety of the movie; I just really preferred Apocalypse's old man look verse what he ended up looking like after the transference.The musical score is what really got me into the opening sequence. Once the music started playing, I was hooked. The action during the opening sequence was good also, it's pretty reminiscent of DOFP's opening, but I'll say that I prefer Apocalypse's opening just a tad bit more, and I think that's because the musical score was so good (it really set the tone). The only negative thing about the opening was its CGI; The CGI was so bad that it kind of took me out of the sequence, it also kind of took me out of the movie. The CGI basically ruins this movie, it makes me think, where did the budget go, and DOFP had better CGI than this; Honestly, the CGI looks so bad that its laughable. Maybe this movie was way too big for its britches? Studio's have this belief that the sequel always needs to be bigger than its predecessor, I however don't believe that. I ultimately don't care about the scope of a movie, I care about the story, and I care about the characters. If your movie can hook me with the story and characters alone, than you've already won the battle. The scope of your movie doesn't always need to be grander in scale, you can create something small, and you can make it seem larger than life without having to over do it. Yes, I know this is an X-Men movie, and its characters are larger than life, but the movie doesn't have to sacrifice its concept for an abundance of special effects. Frankly speaking, if you don't have the budget for it, than create something smaller, you can execute the same idea, but you'll just have to find a different approach for it.The ending action sequence was pretty dull and boring. The only exciting element during the ending battle was when Apocalypse tried to control Professor Xavier. Mcavoy's performance during that ending transference scene was edge of the seat suspense, I was legitimately concerned for the well-being of his character, and Apocalypse's rage/whinny baby reaction after the transference had failed was stellar.The only action scenes I liked where the opening and Ouicksliver scene, everything else was forgettable.A majority of the actors delivered good performances, yes this includes Jennifer Lawrence. I don't mind JLaw as Mystique, I just hate the fact that she's in the spotlight. When Rebecca Romijn played Mystique, she had her moments to shine, and she delivered, but she was never the focal point. The only reason Mystique is at the center of attention is because she's played by JLaw, in my opinion, that's catering to the actor. JLaw's Mystique is the perfect example of the actor revolving around the character and not the other way around.Ben Hardy (Angel/Arc-Angel) and Olivia Munn (Psylocke) are completely underutilized, their stories are insignificant and inefficient. Alexandra Shipp (Storm) was slightly underutilized, Singer should've given her more character to chew on, but she did a good job with what she had to work with, she ran with it, and it was pretty cool.Josh Helman (Stryker) didn't need to be in this movie, he just pops in out of nowhere, his appearance is warranted, but he's just there to set- up Wolverine's entrance.Lana Condor (Jubilee) is barely in the movie, but that's okay because the actor did what she could, she was great in the role, and I hope I see more of her in future X-Men movies. I think Jubilee had more dialog than Arc-Angel and Psylocke combined.Oscar Isaac (Apocalypse) was great, I was immersed in the character, and the actor's portrayal was spot on. Magneto has more to do here than any other character (besides Xavier & Apocalypse). I felt for Magneto when his family died, I understood his reasoning for wanting to join the horsemen, and I liked that he went fully bad in this movie (sort of). By the end of the movie, Magneto betrays Apocalypse because he feels that he has betrayed his fellow X- Men or Charles, he thinks back to the events of First Class, and he has the realization that he has been hurting them or him all along. I liked that Magneto had his little moment at the end, but damn he surly does change sides fast. I thought Magneto changing sides happened way to prematurely, it really didn't hold any emotional weight for me, and I think it would've been better if he had died fighting Apocalypse or the X-Men. Honestly, where on earth can this character go from here, he shouldn't get a pass just because he saved the world, he also had a hand in destroying it, and him turning fully good doesn't fit the character's arc at all.Overall, I enjoyed this movie, and I had fun with it. Is it better than DOFP, no. Is it the worst X-Men movie, no. Does it have problems, yes. Would I add this to my good X-Men movie collection, yes because I think this movie is pretty good. X-Men: Apocalypse is definitely in my top five favorite X-Men movies, but yes this movie could've been so much better.

Darabont is an awesome writer and director, and for the most part the film itself is awesome. The character development is effective, casting is good, the special effects and creature design are excellent, and the film is well-directed. Probably Marcia Gay Harden\\'s best performance. Thomas Jane did well, too, and the supporting cast was wonderful.If you\\'ve never read the original short story, you\\'ll probably love everything about this film. I was a little disappointed that David and Amanda\\'s sexual encounter was removed (it seemed to de-King things for me) but this is something easily gotten over. However, the new ending is AWFUL in my opinion. At the end of the movie, I felt like someone made me a flawless ice cream sundae and then spit in it for no good reason.First of all, you have to realize that the scariest aspect of the original story is that there was no end, no easy solution, no happy ending. The story ended, but in your mind the characters kept going--off into who knows what. No one was in control and survival was the only goal. On the other hand, Darabont\\'s ending, which was an annoying \"gotcha\" twist, ruined this part of the story. We learn the ultimate fate of the main characters. We learn the ultimate fate of the world: government has things under control. \"The Mist\" went from being a never-ending, mysterious horror to a temporary disaster, essentially stripping it of its power and imagination.That brings me to my next point: the original story is pretty cynical towards the status quo. The military-industrial complex causes a problem that it cannot fix. Akin to nuclear or biological war, our government has basically destroyed the world beyond comprehension. So, there was a moral to King\\'s version. Unfortunately, the new ending also denies us this moral. Darabont\\'s ending shows the government in control, regaining some moral high ground, cleaning up its mess and restoring law and order. Anarchy was never there. This more nationalistic ending will be very disappointing for people who loved the original.Third, it really goes against the character development to have an ending where all the survivalists commit suicide. We\\'re led to believe that these people have courage, skills, intelligence, etc., and we witness them using these abilities to escape both monsters and a human mob...only to kill themselves when they run out of gas? I think it\\'s more likely that they would make a run for a building or remember to fill up...I know that King endorsed the new ending, but I don\\'t care. Sorry--he\\'s simply wrong about this one in my opinion, and anyone who loved reading \"The Mist\" will probably agree. Darabont: (You have redeemed yourself with The Walking Dead) we still love you, but what were you thinking? I was hoping they\\'d release a DVD with an alternate ending, but I haven\\'t seen one to date, so this is what I recommend to make this film go from OK to AMAZING. Just turn the television off a few minutes early. Watch the film, love every minute of it, daydream that a sex scene happened, and then be ready to turn it off as the truck drives off into the mist in absolute uncertainty, just like it did in the original story...',\n",
